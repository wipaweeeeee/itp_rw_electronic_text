[Intro: Tom Misch]
Crazy dream (x8)

[Hook: Tom Misch]
And as I wake up from this crazy dream
I hope that things remain as they seem
Cause as I wake up from this crazy dream
From this dream

[Verse 1: Loyle Carner]
I had a dream about you last night
And we were listening to Pharcyde
Something to something started spinning in the past life
So I kept the singing to the bar side, we were on the last ride
Saying it's the past but the present moving fast I ain't thinking bout the last time
It's fine, but they were saying did you ask my
Brothers if I'm ready for the last line
Never in the way you move with
It's bugging me out
I kept squeak, left feet don't trouble me now
It gets peaked if the D starts loving the sound
But we were running from the beast, start fucking around
Cos if I break the singular jack, cause a little bit of trouble fill a fifth of the yack
It's not that quick to react if I finish the pact we move forward now, I'm bringing it back

[Hook: Tom Misch]
And as I wake up from this crazy dream
I hope that things remain as they seem
Cause as I wake up from this crazy dream
From this dream
Crazy dream (x8)

[Bridge: Loyle Carner]
She was saying
Don't start but we feel it at the same time
Won't part, but repeat it in the same shine
So dark gotta kneel it in the rain, it's fine
Lost part but she's reeling 'n the blame is mine
Is mine, mine, mine

[Hook: Tom Misch]
And as I wake up from this crazy dream
I hope that things remain as they seem
Cause as I wake up from this crazy dream
From this dream
And as I wake up from this crazy dream
I hope that things remain as they seem
Cause as I wake up from this crazy dream
From this dream
Crazy dream (x10)


[Verse 1]
We don't need a love affair
Listen to the sounds of this up here
We don't need to lay in bed
Waking up from place to place
We don't need to pay our rent
Listen to the sounds of this right here
We don't gotta pave our way
We can live from place to place

[Hook]
C'mon love let's get away
Listen to the sounds of this up here
Take your money to the bank
Tell em we gonna throw it all away
Candy coated painted moods
Listen to the sound of it in you

[Verse 2]
We don't need a love affair
Listen to the sounds of this up here
We don't need to lay in bed
Sleep all day we'll sleep when dead
We don't need to wait on them
Listen to the sounds of this right here
We don't need to pave our way
Take this love on face to face

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Take your money to the bank
Tell em we gonna throw it all away
Freedom brings a paper chase
Tell em we got soul and we gonna stay
Righteous fallen people pray
But we got something real
That you're going to hate

Make a test and change your name
Nobody has the power but you and me
Baby you run for you and you run for me
We gonna tell em what it is
Yeah we don't care
Gotta live our lives and don't look back
Best believe I believe in love
Yeah I got the faith
Just to be the lights of the days
Play it out from place to place and get away

[Verse 1]
Six years old
Staring at my nose in the mirror
Trying to dip my toes in the mirror
Thinking 'Who's that girl?'
And 'Does the mirror world go on forever?'
Carmenia Road
Sharpening the knives in the attic
Trying to watch cartoons through the static
Thinking where am I gonna be
If I'm ever twenty-three? Oh

[Chorus]
I'm looking at a life unfold
Dreaming of the green and gold
Just like the ancient stone
Every sunrise I know
Those eyes you gave to me
That let me see
Where I come from

[Verse 2]
Found an old friend
Meeting my guitar in the city
Feeling like a star in the city
And suddenly it seems that I'm where I'm supposed to be, oh
And now I'm fully grown
And I'm seeing everything clearer
Just sweep away the dust from the mirror
We're walking hand in hand on the warm white sands

[Chorus]
I'm looking at a life unfold
Dreaming of the green and gold
Just like the ancient stone
Every sunrise I know
Those eyes you gave to me
That let me see
Where I come from

[Breakdown]
Ancient stone
Oh, green and gold
Ancient stone
Oh, green and gold
Ancient stone
Oh, green and gold
Ancient stone
Green and gold

[Chorus]
I'm looking at a life unfold
Dreaming of the green and gold
Just like the ancient stone
Every sunrise I know
Those eyes you gave to me
That let me see
Where I come from

I'm looking at a life unfold
Dreaming of the green and gold
Just like the ancient stone
Every sunrise I know
Those eyes you gave to me
That let me see
Where I come from

[Breakdown]
Ancient stone
Oh, green and gold
Those eyes you gave to me (Ancient stone)
Oh, green and gold (you gave to me, to me)
Ancient stone
Oh, green and gold

[Verse 1: JMSN]
Staring out the window, waiting for life to stop
Cus everything I been through, never seems to let up
Someone ask me why I feel like I feel, take pill after pill
I wish I could chill politic, and play the game
I dont know the fake from the real, the weight of the steel
From the things that I kill
When I sign my life away

[Hook: JMSN]
Oh you know I want this
I know you need it too
Lets be alone, ah yeah
Lets be alone, ah yeah
Oh you know I want this
I know you need it too
Lets be alone, ah yeah
Lets be alone, ah yeah

Lets be alone, ah yeah
Lets be alone, ah yeah

[Verse 3: JMSN]
I'mma keep it simple, forget the act
I just gotta have ya'
And I'll never stop

[Hook]

[Bridge: JMSN]
I'mma give you what I want, the only thing I need
You call me in my dreams, even when I'm not asleep
Even when I'm not asleep
Your the only thing I got, its clear for me to see
No matter the degree, this is where I wanna be
This is where I wanna be
This is where I wanna be

[Hook]

[Verse 1]
I'm a little shy, but I know you know
I haven't done this too much, cause I did not know

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm feeling this devotion, touching your emotion
I can see the love run right out of you
Moments like these are golden, never felt so open
Even if I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming with you

[Chorus]
So breathe my air, and kiss me there
Cause I'm a little cold but I'll warm up with you
Heart out my chest when you put it there
Yeah I’m a little cold but I've warmed up with you
Ooo, ooo, I...
Ooo, ooo, I...
Ooo, ooo, I...
Ooo, ooo, I...

[Verse 2]
I don't care too much for valentines
I just need your skin next to mine

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm feeling this devotion, touching your emotion
I can see the love run right out of you
Moments like these are golden, never felt so open
Even if I'm dreaming, I'm dreaming with you

[Chorus]
So breathe my air, and kiss me there
Cause I'm a little cold but I'll warm up with you
Heart out my chest when you put it there
Yeah I’m a little cold but I've warmed up with you
Woo, ooh, I...
Ooo, ooo, I...
Ooo, ooo, I...
Ooo, ooo, I...
