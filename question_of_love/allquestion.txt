Thank you very much for your mail and the lovely photos. Did you have a good time in Hongkong? It must have been nice spending time as a whole family again.Where does Peson work now? Is he still near you?

I've never talk anything about you to koo-MENG, this last Sunday, he just came to me and ask me with strange question that Is Peson coming back?  I was quite surprised, so he told me about the CEO he met on Saturday and about the job.I think you should look at it, it doesn't hurt, it may give us lots of "by-product", even we will not accept the job. Or who knows, they may offer you a part time job, so you can also work on your fifthfloor too. It's a win-win situation.

what's about Haribo?
What do you mean? Not really a Haribo, right? We have a lot here also. The world is getting small.
3. stay at KT. ? (is it there still? will find out if you really want me to book.)
could you please tell me the exact date you are in Bangkok? If possible, I would like to host you at my place on the river.
can you write back? What nightly rate they are using? Pls ask them to give a clear figure from their side.
Did I miscalculate or misunderstand anything? Please advise.
I am the co-host. And I mark price as $55 per night. Where does airbnb get these rate?

Perhaps there's no good coffee in the airport? A foot massage might be a better bet? I don't mind either way.

Thai Airways just informed me that they are leaving at 13:45 tomorrow, a few minutes earlier than planned but I never believe airlines.Chu, I gave you the flight number already, right? Just in case:
TG 921 Frankfurt - Bangkok non-stop.Wipi insisted she could come back by taxi. She doesn't want you to wait. She said airport has bad coffee (haha). Anyway, we need to check her side as well how her plane arrives (on time or not). She will give me a hint when her plane leaves from Taipei (if possible). Yours is easy ... direct flight.Do you have what's app or line? It may be easier to contact. But it doesn't matter.
One last question, I do not think Thailand has problems with a passport who has a Lebanon-stamp in it? Hysterics about terror do not go that far I hope.I don't think so. You may give them our address and phone no.10/5 Ladphrao Rd. 89, Wangtonglang, Bangkok 10310 ... phone no. 083-815-7616. I am sure you know how to handle with all thai authorities.
Ah, and is it hot or super hot at the moment?very hot. Hope some cool weather may come again. (last week it's cool for 1-2 days)
how does it work? This year is less than 20,000.-$
How about next year? Should we change to thai acc.?

I don't even know that he already wrote back. How could I say thanks to them? Normally if airbnb sent this to you .. I will be able to write back to say thank you to them.

Hi Midori,Thank you for your prompt response! And yes, I'm a greencard holder.From what you say it seems like I could get workstudy loan but I won't have to start working until next semester? My initial understanding was that loan is given annually and so if I sign up for workstudy i would have to work for the whole year? May be this is a John Brown question..if so, please let me know. I plan to contact him as soon as he's back.
Also, in terms of workstudy positions, is there a listing or anywhere I should be looking to see what the options are?
Hi Wipawe,You are a greencard holder, right? If you have workstudy on your loan package, then yes you can work for NYU and you will probably have an easier time to find a job since hiring a workstudy student is cheaper for the university. We will have workstudy positions at ITP but they are more technical.
I hope this email finds you well. I have a couple of questions regarding loan and ITP schedule: I see that there's about $3000 loan option to do work-study and I think that means I do work within NYU campuses, right? I'm just wondering if you know when is the last day I have to decide to take loan or not because I want to wait until i get my schedule first to see how much time I have to in order to do part time job or otherwise I'll work within campus.

Did they give you check already from last week work?

- We would like to do a tea ceremony before the rehearsal (before 5 pm)  on Friday night on the pool deck (maybe lounge). Would you be able to provide a tea pot and some tea cups at this time?
- On Saturday, could you provide a decorated table with fresh flowers for signing in guests near the ceremony area?
For red and white wine you would like us to provide for you or you will bring by your own?
Would you be able to provide a basket to hold our programs prior to the ceremony?
Would you be able to provide a box to hold sand and sparklers?Yes, No problem
- have something to light sparklers with?We will provide the match for light sparklers
And just a few more logistical questions from our end:Towards the beginning of the conversation, you were asking about the traditional sky lanterns, is this still a detail you are interested in?Is there anything special you would like us to arrange for your guests' arrivals, outside of our customary welcome (non alcoholic) drink and cold towel? In addition, it would be greatly appreciated if you could send a guest list and preferred seating. Using this, we will print up name cards to arrange on the tables on the day of the ceremony.Do your guests have any sort of favorite drink? We are currently reviewing our inventory and would like to know if there is anything we should stock up on. Lastly, do you have a copy of the schedule for the wedding night? Also, do you have any specific agenda you are planning on having your guests follow for any other part of the rest of the stay? If not, I have attached a list of things to do nearby that they may be interested in. We can talk about group pricing if you think anything sounds particularly like they would enjoy. If so, can you send it over so we can plan accordingly? Thank you so much, and I look forward to hearing from you.​Yours Sincerely, Kanitta Jatutain (Nana) |  Reservations & Revenue Manager, Bangkok HANSAR HOTELS & RESORTS |  Bangkok  |  Koh Samui  |  Pranburi

these are outside bangkok. They just think they can travel around thailand, instead of just staying in bangkok?

My mom just told me that Wip is in Thailand (I didn't know that). Can you extend an invitation to her for all the events as well as to the ceremony and resort?
As you see on the airbnb site the space is rather narrow. Can you show us the crib you want for Maddie so we can figure out how it works? Airbnb is not for you to book. You are our special guests.
Should we have line so we can contact easier?
Thanks for the response. Not sure what you mean by having a line so we can contact easier? Do you mean talk on the phone?

1. Hansar - We requested to see how the tables for dinner will be laid out so we can start planning a seating chart, but the hotel doesn't seem to understand what we need or can provide one to us. Do you think you can contact them to see if they can send it to us?
Would it be possible for you to see how what the cost for the roundtrip is for these companies as well as the one you provided?
4. Sparklers - We would like to give our guests some sparklers for before dinner so that they can wave them when Katie and I come in. Are these available for sale in Thailand and how much do they cost?
and for the bolded ones, that specific brand. Can you confirm that these are all available for purchase in Thailand so we don't need to buy them in the US and bring them with us?
6. Rehearsal Dinner - Katie found this restaurant called Thai Thai to have dinner after the Wedding Rehearsal on Friday night. We need to know how many people the restaurant can hold as it looks like as many as 50 people will be coming to dinner. If it is a small place, we may need to book out the whole place. We are planning to do dinner around 6PM or 6:30PM. Also need to confirm if they accept credit cards. Would you be able to contact them for us with the questions we have? They don't have a phone number posted and not sure if Hansar would know.
7. Photographer/Videographer - Thank you for putting down the deposit. Can you let me know how/when they expect to be paid the balance. Should we provide a credit card when get to Thailand for them to charge or will they be expecting cash on the day of the wedding?
I got excited and would like to be sure that everything is well prepared. Did I miss anything since the below mail? Has the new coordinator (Bier) answered all your requests and all things are confirmed? Hoping not to spend too much on the items which are not quite clear or necessary.

Did you have a nice Christmas? I had all my family here to celebrate Christmas day. You know my living room. It was really crowded but I did enjoy it. The family seems to get bigger by the year. Before I thought when my nephews were grown up they would do their own thing. But instead they are coming now with wife and girlfriend. I do enjoy it having all the young people around me. The only unfortunate thing is that you feel really old among them. New Years I spent at home. So it was a very quiet start. Did not even have a glass of champaign because I forgot to buy it.
How is life? We miss you and hope to see you some day.
We hope that Heinz and Elke could join you for a visit to Thailand next year. (have already the date?) We really look forward to.
Did you know that a good education means more than acquiring knowledge? As a well-educated person, you know how to apply knowledge so that you live a good life, making wise choices.  Wisdom means that you make right choices based on the knowledge you have. And wisdom does not come from just sitting in a classroom or from studying books. How do we get wisdom?
The Bible tells us that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. How does that work?  Sometimes if we think that we can get away with something, we may end up making a bad choice.  But when we fear the Lord, we know that we are accountable to Him for everything we think, say, and do.  He sees us all the time, and He knows our motives.
what is their business? Just heard about it from radio ... marketing online. Nong said Pi Wan is interested in your business idea.

Again Section 316.5(c) (1) (i) states thus The types of documentation which may establish that the applicant did not disrupt the continuity of his or her residence in the United States during an extended absence include, but are not limited to, evidence that during the absence:The applicant did not terminate his or her employment in the United States;The applicants immediate family remained in the United States;The applicant retained full access to his or her United States abode; orThe applicant did not obtain employment while abroad.It can be gathered in the above provision of the CFR that in order that you can prove you did not disrupt your continuous residence in the United States is that you did not commit acts that may be construed as an intent to reside elsewhere.Those acts could be if you resigned from your work and then you brought your family to another country and you enrolled your children to school there and then you and your wife looked and found worked in that foreign country.Mean while you either gave up your apartment in the U.S. or you listed your house to be sold then I would like to believe that should you have a change of heart after 9 months and decide to return to the U.S. there is no doubt in my mind that you will not be able to overcome the presumption that you disrupted your continuous residence.You may not have lost your status as an LPR but your residence for purposes of applying for U.S. Citizenship or Naturalization will definitely be delayed.So when can you apply for Naturalization if your continuous residence was disrupted?8 CFR Section 316.5(c)(1)(ii) states thus An applicant  who must satisfy a five year statutory residence period may file an application for naturalization four years and one day following the date of applicants return to the United States to resume permanent residence. An applicant  who must satisfy a three year statutory residence period may file an application fro naturalization two years and one day following the date of the applicants return to the United States to resume permanent residence.The above section presupposes that the LPR left the U.S. for 1 year or more to have disrupted their continuous residence, this requirement presumably applies to those who left for over 6 months and returned in less than 1 year but failed to satisfy the USCIS that their continuous residence was not disrupted, because this provision prescribes the requirement for those whose continuous residence has been disrupted.So the waiting time upon return is 4 years and 1 day for those with 5 year residency requirement and 2 years and 1 day for those with 3 years residency requirement. Active military service in time of hostilities needs to wait only 1 year before they can apply for U.S. Citizenship, but 3 years in time of peace.In order to avoid having to prove to the USCIS that your continuous residence was not disrupted because you left the U.S. for less than 1 year but over 6 months, limit your travels outside of the U.S. for less than 6 months each time you leave. That way your continuous residency will not be a problem when you apply for naturalization.Consult an attorney to find out if you satisfy the rest of the naturalization requirements so you can apply soonest.[We invite readers to call Atty. A.Erwin Bautista to set up their consultation. Atty.

Naturalization if your continuous residence was disrupted?
Beginning Monday, April 23, the Daily News and the City University of New York will hold our 10th annual CUNY/Daily News Citizenship Now! call-in. Since the call-in began, we have answered almost 98,000 of your questions. This year, that number will surpass 100,000. The call-in is an opportunity for readers to get the information they need to become a U.S. citizen, permanent resident or get other immigration benefits.More than 400 attorneys, government-accredited paralegals and trained community advocates will staff the call-in. If after speaking to an advocate you think you qualify for a benefit, the advocate will refer you to someone who can help you complete the necessary forms. The call-in will run from April 23 to April 27, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m with separate phone lines for English and Spanish callers. We will have available speakers of dozens of other languages as well. Besides the Daily News and CUNY, this years sponsors include media partner Univision, and sponsors Cisco, the American Immigration Lawyers Association, the Legal Aid Society, Gristedes, WADO 1280 AM, La Que Buena 92.7 and BlueWater, a Presidio Company.Youll find the call-in phone numbers in the April 23 Daily News.Meanwhile, to prepare you for the call-in, over the next few weeks, Ill answer some common questions about citizenship and immigration law. We start our discussion with the rules for naturalizing  the process where a permanent resident becomes a U.S. citizen. Today we discuss the continuous residence requirement for U.S. citizenship.Q. How long must I be a permanent resident to qualify to naturalize?A. Most naturalization applicants must have been a continuous resident for at least five years. The requirement is three years if you have been married to, and living with, the same U.S. citizen for the last three years while a permanent resident. You may file your application three months before you meet the five (or three) years of permanent residence. Special rules apply to veterans and members of the military. Ѥ.If you came here as a refugee, your permanent residence date should be backdated to the day you arrived in the United States. If you were an asylee, it should be backdated on year. So, refugees count permanent residence since their day of entry, asylees one year from before the date the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service granted them permanent residence.Continuous residence means you never abandoned your U.S. residence. If you have been abroad for a continuous period of more than six months, the USCIS may contest your continuous residence. Still, even after more than six months abroad, if you can prove that your primary residence was in the U.S., you should be able to show continuous residence. So for instance, if you were studying abroad, you would bring a school transcript to your interview. If you were taking care of a sick relative, you would bring a letter from a doctor. If you were simply vacationing, bring proof that you maintained a residence in the U.S. That proof might include a bank account, credit card account, proof that you returned to a job you had before you left, or an apartment lease.  credit card ... transcript ç¹ ѹ˹  Ҩ.uc Һҹѡҡ˹ չAfter one continuous year or more abroad, you need either a reentry permit issued by the USCIS or a special immigrant visa issued by a U.S. consul abroad to return. Note that in most cases, if you have been abroad for more than 365 continuous days, even with USCIS permission, with limited exceptions, that will break your period of continuous residence.If you entered after more than a year abroad with your permanent resident card only, but the immigration inspector didnt realize that you had been abroad so long, a USCIS naturalization examiner will nevertheless consider you to have abandoned your residence. If you were abroad for more than a year without USCIS permission, speak to an immigration law expert before applying to naturalize. Youll want to make sure you have a current claim to permanent residence. Otherwise, you risk being deported.The law exempts certain business travelers, religious workers, government employees, researchers for a U.S. research agency, seamen and women and members of the military from the continuous residence requirement.If you are abroad for less than six continuous months, to deny you naturalization, USCIS would need to prove that you had abandoned your residence. So, trips abroad of six months or less, are rarely a problem. Thats true even if those trips were often and lengthy. Further, USCIS is most concerned about recent trips. Trips many years ago of less than one year, even though longer than six months, arent normally a problem with most naturalization examiners. ԧMembers of the military serving during wartime qualify to naturalize without regard to the continuous residence requirement. Based on an order signed byPresident Bush in 2002, those serving on Sept. 11, 2001 and after, until a U.S. President ends the program, benefit from this rule. PROMOTED STORIES

Don't worry too much ... concentrate on your work. You plan and let us know. If we could make it we will see you then. Wipi has already booked her flight, starting from NYC on 1st Oct. so her trip will be extended until end of October. It's your idea that she should visit her family in Germany but she is not sure whether she could make it or not. The point is if she would go home (Bangkok) after the trip she will have too much luggage for travelling. Sofar I know she will station at Copenhagen (a friend has a place there) and travel around to London, Greece, Paris and Spain. She has not booked her return flight yet. I told her if she is visiting Germany she will know how to come back to Copenhagen by your help. Is this right?
What do we do now? and as usual I am not
one time?) from October 1
to 21 and then she goes on to Bangkok? partly answer up there. I will cc: Wipi also this mail.
also before Oct 21? or Italy/Germany? If we really go, Italy would be more interesting since our girl has already visited Spain by then. I don't think we would join Wipi & friends trip in Spain. You take your time for your work in Ramallah. We will plan accordingly.

Betreff: one short question My dear Anita, How is life in Ireland? We hope you enjoy your stay a lot. Get some rest and back to work with full energy ... Well, I did not make it to Ireland because I waited too long and the flight got too expensive for the short trip, so I ended up on the train to Bavaria/Tegernsee. But it was nice and relaxing indeed! Wipi is planning her holidays. It could be around 24th Sept - 14th Oct.  She is searching for cheap flights.  So she starts asking whether we have interest to join her somewhere. I remember you told me your Spain trip with Roswitha is around Oct 20 - 31. We would like to know: 1. Is it possible to stay with you on the week of Oct. 14? If we really join her. Oct 14 is a Tuesday, so you mean the week 13 -18 ? For me it is ok if we decide soon soon (need to block it here).  2. Is it nice to organize a trip to Italy?   Italy, Rome or whatever is wonderful and always good visiting even in autumn.  Just inquire this information from you. We are not yet sure we are going to make this trip.  no hurry! lots of love,Chu
How is life in Ireland? We hope you enjoy your trip a lot. Get some rest and back to work with full energy ...

Are you preparing tax return and the software you use is asking you to pay for "audit defense"?  They just  IRS may audit your tax return so you buy whatever they sell. Don't worry. You don't need it. Don't buy.  The chance you get audited is very slim because it's a simple tax return and not big money.

would be nice if you know the BTS exit number....If i remember correctly its exit number 3....? And may be a rough walking distance/landmark? I just know that there's intersection. May be if you can, go up to BTS station and take a picture of the building from when ur up in the station. So that way its easy to locate.

Hi Wipawe! I'm thrilled to have been able to book your accommodations. If you have a chance, can you please send along instructions on how to best reach the apartment from the airport (DMK)? I can't seem to see the detailed address on the booking itinerary. Thanks again!

Could you please spare some time in your hiding of the heavy snow in NYC to send Anita some photos to show how you like the place at Urbano?
How are you doing by the way? I'm kind of sad I didn't get to go to Frankfurt to see the booth I designed/see you and the family. It's a wholesale event for buyers and I have no business/selling skills so I'm stuck here in New York. Poor me! Haha. It's been too long since I last saw you. I've gain and lost a total of 10 kgs in the past few years so for a lot of people I've changed a lot. May be I'll look the same to you since last I saw you I was about this size as well haha!
My bestfriend from college is now living in Hamburg so I have been planning a Euro trip with her. I'm not sure when it will happen (hopefully by September this year) but I'll make sure to visit my Auntie Anita! (I'm very interested to go to Spain and Greece, do you have suggestions!?) If not you are more than welcome to come visit me (and may be Peson as well since we are close by) in New York, or we can find our ways to serenity back in Urbano in Bangkok!

more about her. let me know. i have to accept or decline within 24 hours of her request otherwise i'll get penalty. I think she's fine..? but if you aren't willing to just tell me.
Hi again! Thanks so much for the fast response. I live and work in Toronto as an Analyst at a financial institution. My son, Ivan, is actually the one taking the photo in my profile picture :) He moved away from home to Paris about a year ago - first to wrap up his business degree and now for work. He's currently at a tech startup in the music streaming market. Although he loves it, he booked himself a getaway in April to South East Asia. He has one night in Bangkok before he flies to Hong Kong, and that's where I plan to meet him! I thought it would be a nice treat to book him a nice place with a pool, and your apartment more than fits the bill! Not sure if you're able to look it up, but I believe his own profile page is number 375140? I know you might not believe me because I'm his mom, but he's a very kind and respectful young man. Hope that gives you a bit of an idea :)

1. what do you mean by saying it's a job? Do they have other benefit except paying daily 50$?2. do you also apply to other companies? all just 2 as you mentioned before.
want to talk skype?
But I'm hesitating in taking it - not sure if it's worth it since they only gonna pay stipend ($50 a day) and most of their clients are non-profit (which I'm not really into) but its a job..and may be its better than doing nothing? or is it better to hold off a bit and may be set forth to only look for freelance job or full time job? what do you think? I might have to give answer to him soon.
it takes more time for a full-time job to reply...i mean...whats there lost if im just an intern that cost 50$ a day?

P.S. Is Charlene feeling o.k.? You said the younger one is doing better. Hope they both are blessed.
Please do so.  Please ask her to introduce herself whenever she can.  Where is her job? My daughters are doing ok in the new school.  The younger one is doing better.   I will not be able to go to Thailand this March.  How often is the reunion?  I wish I know well in advance next time .
My daughter is in town since last Nov. She told me she went to Thai Orchid from time to time. I asked whether anybody there recognized her. She said no. Would you like her to introduce herself to khun Nong? She got an intern job without paid. Still looking for a new offer.
How are your kids? The two girls are already settled well at colleges?
P.S. Satrivid 18 will re-unite this year March 9. Are you coming?
But most important of all, they are paying $850 a WEEK. (possibly $3400 a month?) the internship runs for 12 weeks starting January.
Friday 11am should work for me. However, I have one final question: Can I know about the pay of this internship? I'm interested in moving and also interested in the company but I have to make budget justification. It would be very helpful to know the estimates of the pay.
There is no problem for me to fly back to meet with you guys at my own cost. However, I would still want to know more about the pay so I can make my decision. And also, is there a big chance for me to get this intern position ie. are there a lot of candidates?
My apologies, I got my dates mixed up. Are you available on Dec 11th instead to come into our office? Let me know this works and if you have any conflicts that day that we should work around.
I also have a question regarding this internship: would it be a paid-position?
Thanks for your interest in the Design Intern position at Prophet. We had a chance to review your resume and your portfolio and would like to invite you into our office to meet the team and share more of your work. Any chance you are available tomorrow or Monday, 12/10 to come in to our office in SF? Let me know what your schedule looks like and Ill coordinate with our design team.
if they contact you tomorrow for a concrete interview date then you should book your flight. Are there more job openings in NY?  so then you can plan for how long you are going to stay there. But I know this is difficult.
please dont forward to everyone in the world. not a big deal. jst saying. this is a paid job. may be i should go? if so, please send money.thank you.
Since I'm not in New York right now, I can do phone/skype interview this week if you want. However my schedule is pretty open in the following week. I can fly over on Monday. Would it be possible to set an interview any day after Tuesday Oct 30 next week?
When we have time to go thru this so you can plan well?
could download it at USCIS website?
