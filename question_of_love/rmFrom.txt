Dear all,
Thank you very much for your mail and the lovely photos. Did you have a good time in Hongkong? It must have been nice spending time as a whole family again.Where does Peson work now? Is he still near you?
This year I spent X-mas and New Year on my own. I had lost my voice for a few days and was not allowed to speak, so I stayed at home and stayed quiet. I have to look for some photographs. I doubt that I have recent ones, because I am not very good in taking photos.
You couldo send some sunshine. It is freezing cold around here. Tonight they forecasted -15 degrees C. It is not very nice.
Have a good  year, all the best for you all
Lots of love - Roswitha

Dear Roswitha,
Thanks for your nice season's greeting card. Happy hearing from you and knowing you have good health and a growing happy family. Some photos from your side would be nice.
We had good time in Hong Kong after Christmas for 3 days. (photos attached)
Wipi is leaving us next Saturday for her study which will end in May 2017. Not sure where she is planning for her job.
Peson enjoys his new job. We are okay at our office work. Getting old but still having some energy [?]
We miss you and wish you a good New Year, good health and happiness.
Hope to see you soon.
lots of love,
Chu, Wiworn, Peson & Wipi

oh ... I was looking at the details as you did... same time ... must be "love" [😊]
We should be there latest on May 16. She said we should see her show (work).
And attend the ceremony on May 19, at 11 am.
We don't know yet for how many days we will be in NYC, before or After the ceremony.
It's still flexible.
Ok thanks, this is exactly the period of my travel to Sri Lanka as planned so far. But I will talk to my colleague.
One question, the important ceremony is on May 19, right?
And you will be there for the whole period?
Bfn,
Anita

Dear All,
Thank you very much for the lovely rose you sent me. I just received your mail via Anita today.
I had a very nice birthday which I celebrated with Frau Heiliger. We went for a few days to a very nice part in Southern Germany. This area is known for its lovely countryside - really nice little villages - but also for its wines and the good food they serve there. So we enjoyed it all. We took some long walks through the vineyards and the villages. It was also very near to France and Switzerland. So we did a daytrip to Basel/Switzerland. It was a sunny day and we could sit at the river Rhine and enjoy the sunshine. As you know it is the time of the year when the sun is not seen too often.
The rehabilation was ok and I hope that the therapy will help in the long run. They gave me a programme with exercises which I am supposed to do every day. I hope that I will be succesful in doing that. Coming Monday I will start work again. It feels really strange after such a long break.
I would really love to see you all in Germany.
Thanks again - lots of love
Roswitha
N.B. It was really good that I the mail today, so I could send Wipi some birthday wishes.
what is your ba acc.no.?
Let me know.
Yes, I am the one behind my mother.
I like the ideal of sending the money to your daughter.  Let me know the information.  That feels safer.  I was concerned about how to send money to Thailand safely.
Where is your daughter studying?
Just got this photo from the historian, hahaha! He got it from an elder yesterday.
Are you the one standing with glasses? :)
May I give you some tip. My daughter is now studying in New York. Your mother may send the money through her channel.  I can give thai baht to Supa if this sounds easier.
Just for your information.
Best regards,
Churaiporn
P.S. I just receive your other mail.
Perhaps I should let you both contact directly.
Wip, Could you please send your ba acc. again to Anna?
Thanks!
I am not able to see your daughter's information.  Not sure why.
Below is the info of my daughter's bank acc.. Her name is Wipawe Sirikolkarn.
If there is any problem, please let us know.
Thanks!
[cid:157d68928a640077f271]
if she replies I will let you proceed with acc. no.

nothing to provide for your landlord.
Do everything like last last landlord should be enough.
Tell them we sponsor your tuition and part of your living. Nobody has that much money, moreover, you share the room with Green or not ... or just let her pay the whole amount and you pay back to her.
All our doc. they need all in thai system .. almost useless na I think.
I need your info.
Hey there Green and Wip!
Congrats on starting an application! I've attached all the necessary Nooklyn paperwork, and in terms of documents, I've detailed below what you will need to submit. :)
From the renters:
- Renter Application (done for Green, attached in email)  this must be physically signed
- Copy of US ID or Passport
- Proof of Income, such as a job offer letter detailing salary  If you're in school, then you can provide proof of that. Letter of enrollment is best, but you can include student loans, transcripts, everything you have to make an impressive file. Also, documents you have concerning tuition will be helpful.
- Most recent tax return (if applicable)   1099's, 1040's, W2's etc
- 3 most recent paystubs (if applicable)
- 3 most recent bank statements (summary only is needed, I can cut off transactions)
- Anything additional that helps a good app (Anything else is bonus! Savings accounts, loans for school, letter of recommendation from a previous landlord, etc. Basically anything that you think will help your file be approved.)
All tenants should be able to prove they are making 40 times their share of the annual rent (2500/2 = 1250. 1250 x 40 = $50000) If that is not your annual income and you are receiving support, anyone supporting you should provide documentation which shows they make 80 times your share of annual rent ($100,000).
Which leads me to...
Guarantor Paperwork!
If you are receiving financial support from someone who does not have American Credit, then they would submit:
- Signed letter saying that they are supporting you (how much they give you monthly etc)
- Copy of their passport
- Proof of their Income, such as a job offer letter detailing their annual salary, (should be around $100,000 USD)  - Their most recent tax return (if applicable)
- 3 most recent paystubs
- 3 most recent bank statements (checking and savings)
- Anything additional that helps a good app (Again, savings accounts, stocks and bonds, etc)
These documents can be printed out and given to me at the office, or preferably all scanned into one PDF file per applicant and emailed to me.
I know this is a bunch of info, so any questions, call or text me at 215 432 4326!
Keep me posted on the progress, let's try and get this in over the next two days
My very best,
 LLC215 432 4326

Dear WIPAWE,
The 2016-17 Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) is now available.  If you'll be going to school between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 2017, and have not submitted a 2016-17 FAFSA, you need to do two things:
Last year you may have used your Federal Student Aid PIN to sign your FAFSA online.  On May 10, 2015, we replaced the PIN with a username and password called the FSA ID.  If you have not yet created an FSA ID for yourself, go to  and create one before you start your FAFSA.  If you provide parental information on your FAFSA, your parent should get his or her own FSA ID.
TIP: You have the option to link your PIN to your FSA ID during the registration process.  If you don't link your PIN or can't remember your PIN, you can still create an FSA ID.  However, you may need to wait up to three days before you can use your FSA ID to start your Renewal FAFSA.
Go to  and click the green "Login" button.  Use your FSA ID to start your FAFSA.
Remember to apply before your deadlines.  Select "Deadlines" at fafsa.gov for specific deadline information.
If you have questions about your FAFSA, online help is available on every page.  Look for "Help and Hints" in a box to the right.
Thank you,

Dear Chu,
uff, the last two weeks were horrible again and at times like this becoming a pensioner looks really promising.
And now, tomorrow morning, I am off to Sri Lanka for two weeks, coming rather close again. I miss you too and I love to think back to the wonderful, relaxing time I had at your home and the apartment Thanks again for everything and we
should do this more often!
Ok, we talk (honestly) again when I am back Feb 19.
Loads of love,
hugs & kisses
for you and Wiworn,
Anita
P.S. And of course warmest greetings to Wipi & Peson!!

I think work study of $3000 means you can work through school and earn 3000 dollars. It is not a loan type.I would accept unsubsidized loan just to be safe. Although you have to pay interest but it is a peace of mind that you have access to money to survive.5% of 20,000= 1,000 dollars. Pay for 2 years = 1,000*2=2,000 dollars. If you don't use it, you can pay back immediately after graduation and lose 2,000 dollars.

i think your dad code the wrong name.

CC: ; 
Peson,Just think of some point about index-consulting.jpWhen I was working with Citibank and want to pursue my dream in software development, I resign from the bank and went to Nida, with salary of 1/4 of what I got from the bank which surely not enough. I went to see my boss at the bank and negotiate with them to get me a parttime job, and they agree. I work for the bank as a partime job for another 3 years. All in all, I got more than what I get from the bank when I left and not suffer any salary lost.
So, the lesson is, if some organization really want you to work for them it's really an opportunity, we should not throw it away
For index-consulting, koo-MENG came to talk to me because he saw your presentation about your kwang-jao project and he told about you to the big boss (CEO) of the firm, and he is interested. But koo-MENG didn't know you are coming back about June, until he met me this last Sunday, that make koo-MENG exciting. If you are interested, he would like to forward your resume to the CEO.
I've never talk anything about you to koo-MENG, this last Sunday, he just came to me and ask me with strange question that Is Peson coming back?  I was quite surprised, so he told me about the CEO he met on Saturday and about the job.I think you should look at it, it doesn't hurt, it may give us lots of "by-product", even we will not accept the job. Or who knows, they may offer you a part time job, so you can also work on your fifthfloor too. It's a win-win situation.

Or who knows, they may offer you a part time job, so you can also work on your fifthfloor too. It's a win-win situation.

I think work study of $3000 means you can work through school and earn 3000 dollars. It is not a loan type.I would accept unsubsidized loan just to be safe. Although you have to pay interest but it is a peace of mind that you have access to money to survive.5% of 20,000= 1,000 dollars. Pay for 2 years = 1,000*2=2,000 dollars. If you don't use it, you can pay back immediately after graduation and lose 2,000 dollars.

what's about Haribo?
thanks for informing that you arrive safely.
Hope you have a good start and don't work too hard. Start slowly ... haha
Wipi is in good shape as seen in the photos! The sun is shining there. But in Bangkok ... no sunshine today!
Wip said something about HARIBO sweets and I did not think it was a joke!
Only short message, I arrived on time, kaputt, but never mind can always dream of the good time I had!!! We will get up till 10 C today radio says.
Hope Wipi made it too and can keep herself warm enough (with the new jacket/coat).
Loads of love,
Anita

Hallo liebe Christel,
wie gesagt, ich bin gerade in Thailand - fliege morgen leider schon zurueck - und wohne in dem wunderbaren Apartment am Fluss. Erstens wollte ich Euch nochmal schoene Gruesse von hier schicken
und auch darauf aufmerksam machen, dass Chu noch auf eine Antwort von Dir wartet, wo sie Euch am 26. Febr. einquartieren soll, da das Apartment erst wieder ab 27.2. frei wird.
Noch ein Tip: HARiBO ist ein gutes Mitbringsel aus D.
Liebe Gruesse an Dich und Wolfgang
und dann wuensche ich Euch auch schon mal eine gute Reise nach Laos und Thailand,
Anita

Dear Christel,
Our apartment near the river will be available from Feb 27 onwards. I will reserve the place for you until March 2.
For 26 of February you may choose as follows:
1. stay on in Laos one more night
or
2. stay at our place (you know our place at Ladprao Road from your visit last time)
or
3. stay at KT. ? (is it there still? will find out if you really want me to book.)
Let me know please.
Love,
Chu

Dear Chu,
thank you a lot for your invitation. We will be definitely on the 26.of February arriving in BKK. And leaving on the 02. of march your country.
We let you know what time we are arriving, so soon we know it.
I would like to know  what can I bring you and your husband from Germany. Please tell me, I don`t come with empty hands or for instant I just hug
you (in German: umarme dich).
I will call you from Laos,
Your friend Christel

they are still active. Reading Bible is good.
Dear Christel,
could you please tell me the exact date you are in Bangkok? If possible, I would like to host you at my place on the river.
Thanks!
Chu

ask him to break down the price exactly like how much per night and multiply with 30 nights.
$55 discount 25% = 13.7530 night = 55-13.75x30 = $1,237.50
can you write back? What nightly rate they are using? Pls ask them to give a clear figure from their side.

Hello Robert,
Thank you for your help!I understand about the service fee. However, I still have couple of questions. From what you explained, it seems that nightly rate you used to calculate is somehow $37 ($1108/30nights) But our current nightly rate is $55 which, if we use monthly discount ($55 - 25%) nightly rate should be $41.25In that case, $41.25x30nights = $1237.50Then minus the 3% service fee, total should be roughly $1200.
Did I miscalculate or misunderstand anything? Please advise.
Thank you so much,Wipawe

Dear Robert Fitzpatrick,
I am the co-host. And I mark price as $55 per night. Where does airbnb get these rate?
4 days in January were at $34.84 per night26 days in February were at $37.24 per nightThis = $1107.84 rounded up = $1108
Please clarify!
Thanks!

Robert Fitzpatrick, Jan 12, 03:22:Hi Wipawe,
Thanks for getting back to me.
4 days in January were at $34.84 per night
26 days in February were at $37.24 per night
This = $1107.84 rounded up = $1108
Here is more information on how monthly pricing is calculated.
Monthly prices are optional pricing settings for hosts. If a listing has a monthly price, it is applied to reservations with 28 nights or more. Guest payments and host payouts for long-term reservations happen monthly.
When reservations take place in multiple calendar months, the nights booked in one month may have a different nightly rate than the nights booked in another month. To get an idea of how monthly prices are calculated (before applicable fees or additional charges a host includes in the pricing settings are added), follow these steps:
1. Divide the monthly price by the number of nights in the month to calculate a nightly rate.
2. Multiply that nightly rate by the number of nights of the reservation in that month.
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each month in the reservation, if needed.
4. Add the result for each month together.
Here are a few examples for a listing with a monthly price of $900:
 Exact calendar month: Check-in April 1, Checkout May 1 (30 nights)
Step 1: $900 per month / 30 nights in April = $30 per night
Step 2: $30 x 30 nights = $900
 Non-exact month: Check-in April 1, Checkout April 29 (28 nights)
Step 1: $900 per month / 30 nights in April = $30 per night
Step 2: $30 x 28 nights = $840
 Two or more calendar months: Check-in April 1, Checkout May 16 (45 nights)
Step 1: $900 per month / 30 nights in April = $30 per night
Step 2: $30 x 30 nights = $900
Step 3: (Repeat Steps 1 & 2 for next month)
$900 per month / 31 nights in May = $29* per night
$29 x 15 nights = $435
Step 4: $900 + $435 = $1335
*Our system only processes whole numbers and rounds to the nearest whole amount.
This information should help you understand a bit more how monthly prices in reservation totals are calculatedthe total will also include any applicable fees and other additional charges a host includes in the pricing settings. Security deposits are not included in the total cost of a listing, and we do not charge service fees on security deposits.
If you have any questions about monthly prices, please contact the host directlythey are your best resource since they customize their own pricing.
If you have any additional questions do not hesitate to contact me again.
Best Wishes,
Robert Fitzpatrick

Anita,
I think gathering is a must. I just changed my mind about the river place. So you stay with us the first two week and after Phuket you may stay the place near the river. Hope this is fine with you.
Will check with your video soon. Got excited, my dear, to see you all.
NO!
I can have a good coffee at the airport and wait for Wipi!
And the either we get picked-up by our dear Chu or we get a taxi together.

I don't mind. Also, I can get home by myself - can get a taxi....easy.
Perhaps there's no good coffee in the airport? A foot massage might be a better bet? I don't mind either way.
Sorry for late reply. Finally done with the show and cleaning up. Doing holiday shopping tomorrow.

see my notes in red!
GREAT, you are a star!
You will come early so and we wait together for Wipi, but you know I do not mind if you come later! And better check the time, before you go to the airport.
Thai Airways just informed me that they are leaving at 13:45 tomorrow, a few minutes earlier than planned but I never believe airlines.Chu, I gave you the flight number already, right? Just in case:
TG 921 Frankfurt - Bangkok non-stop.Wipi insisted she could come back by taxi. She doesn't want you to wait. She said airport has bad coffee (haha). Anyway, we need to check her side as well how her plane arrives (on time or not). She will give me a hint when her plane leaves from Taipei (if possible). Yours is easy ... direct flight.Do you have what's app or line? It may be easier to contact. But it doesn't matter.
One last question, I do not think Thailand has problems with a passport who has a Lebanon-stamp in it? Hysterics about terror do not go that far I hope.I don't think so. You may give them our address and phone no.10/5 Ladphrao Rd. 89, Wangtonglang, Bangkok 10310 ... phone no. 083-815-7616. I am sure you know how to handle with all thai authorities.
Ah, and is it hot or super hot at the moment?very hot. Hope some cool weather may come again. (last week it's cool for 1-2 days)
After that I leave you alone, need to pack my bag now, ha, haOkay... not to much ... you may find anything here.
Have a pleasant flight till we meet!

Dear Chu,
just one question, can you give me your mobile number, i.e. a number
a) my colleagues could use in case of emergency
b) Harry can contact us, just in case - he is getting nervous now.
Reason: I will bring my mobile but sometimes it is not working properly and international phone call is too expensive for Harry
Thanks & best,

Grantsmanship begins with a process of self-definition. Before you can consider asking an
outside organization for assistance, you must consider your personal and family background, any
special awards, honors, or distinctions you have received, as well as your future goals and

Be clear, specific, and creative. At the very least, you should seek to define yourself as broadly

So workstudy is not a loan.
Workstudy is not a loan, meaning you don't have to pay it back. It's money from the government, but you need to work to earn it.Yes you can find work in the Spring semester and still use your workstudy allocation. It may be a little harder to find a workstudy job in the Spring semester as most of the jobs will be taken in the Fall, but I believe you can probably still find something somewhere within NYU.  The allocation does not hold over to next year so whatever you don't use this academic year, you will lose.
You can look at the Wasserman Center for the student jobs. I sent an email about that awhile back. They have an online database or you can go in person when you arrive next week.
Midori.
Hi Midori,Thank you for your prompt response! And yes, I'm a greencard holder.From what you say it seems like I could get workstudy loan but I won't have to start working until next semester? My initial understanding was that loan is given annually and so if I sign up for workstudy i would have to work for the whole year? May be this is a John Brown question..if so, please let me know. I plan to contact him as soon as he's back.
Also, in terms of workstudy positions, is there a listing or anywhere I should be looking to see what the options are?
Thank you so much!Regards,Wipawe
Hi Wipawe,You are a greencard holder, right? If you have workstudy on your loan package, then yes you can work for NYU and you will probably have an easier time to find a job since hiring a workstudy student is cheaper for the university. We will have workstudy positions at ITP but they are more technical.
If you need to take out loans, you should get started sooner than later since it does take a few weeks to process.  John Brown is the main guy in charge of financial aid but he is out of the office until Monday. He will know for sure how long it takes to process a loan..
The Fall tuition is due September 15.
A lot of students do work - maybe 10-15 hours a week but no more than 20.
You could also hold off on working for the first semester as you transition to ITP. Then find a campus job for workstudy for the Spring semester instead.
Hope that helps.Midori.
Hi Midori,
I hope this email finds you well. I have a couple of questions regarding loan and ITP schedule: I see that there's about $3000 loan option to do work-study and I think that means I do work within NYU campuses, right? I'm just wondering if you know when is the last day I have to decide to take loan or not because I want to wait until i get my schedule first to see how much time I have to in order to do part time job or otherwise I'll work within campus.
Please let me know any info you have regarding this or if there's anybody I should reach out to in particular about this.
Thank you so much for your help!Best,Wipawe

Mary C, Jul 27, 06:31:  Hello Wipawe,
Thank you so much for contacting Airbnb! My name is Mary and it's a pleasure to help you today.
I'll be happy to help clarify how a host's monthly pricing is applied to reservations. Keep in mind that when a search is made, the nightly rate shown includes any cleaning and/or extra guest fees, in addition to the standard rate. For longer stays, weekly or monthly pricing will take effect.
A month can be anywhere from 28 to 31 days on Airbnb (following the real calendar) and the system adjusts accordingly to the start date, creating a nightly rate by dividing the monthly rate by the number of nights in the requested month. We have an FAQ on monthly pricing available at: 
Your reservation TE3EB3 with your guest Vivianne recognizes the set price of $1000 per month. Which means $1000 / 31 (nights in August) = $32.25 per night.
Once your guest is staying 30 nights, our system multiplies the $32.25 x 30 nights = $968
Then, after the host service fees for Airbnb, in this case they are $29 (968-29), you will receive an amount of $939.
Dear Wipawe, I hope I was of some help to you today! But if you have any more questions or need further assistance, please let me know by replying to this email! I am here to help you.
My best regards to you,
Mary C

sounds o.k to me.
only hope the new offer stays.
Dear Kendell,
Hope this message finds you well!I have some concerns I want to discuss with you:
An opportunity which I applied before starting with Pottery Barn has eventually got back to me with an offer which match my preference more. This is beyond my control and I did not plan on doing so but I prefer to move forward with that opportunity instead and wish to stop/terminate my contract at Pottery Barn. I know this will bring a lot of complications which I really want to apologize in advance. Please let me know the possibility in terms of timeline and what should be my next step. I have not inform my supervisor yet.
If it is easier to discuss over the phone, please feel free to give me a call anytime. Thank you very much and I look forward to hearing back from you.
Regards,Wipawe

Dear Khun. Churaiporn, Thank you for checking in earlier, I thought I would summarize the solutions we discussed and address the questions I couldn't answer yet during our conversation.For the table layout, rest assured we will be able to fit your entire party. If you like the idea of seated rows with an aisle down the middle leading to the archway with dining tables in a separate section, we will draft the seating plan up complete with floral embellishments. While on the subject of flowers, we have removed carnations entirely from the roster and will replace them with larger quantities of the flowers which have already been approved. Unfortunately, we are unable to place a linen over the sand because it creates a tripping hazard. We also cannot provide the abalone shells, but we will be able to supply the flowers to fill them with. If you are able to arrange for a large bus to transport your guests to the main road outside Hansar Pranburi, we would be glad to provide you with a complimentary shuttle service to our property. We fully appreciate that your party is not heavy drinkers, so would be happy to amend the initial offer. For THB 60,000++, we can give you a credit from which we would deduct the cost of the wine bottles for the tables (about 10 red, 10 white), and then each additional drink your guests order would count against that. The cost of any drinks beyond that budget will be totalled and charged at the end of the event. This is much more cost effective than the open bar option, but will still give your guests freedom in what they choose to order. We can provide a media system which includes speakers, microphone, computer cord, projector, and screen for THB 15,000++. This will all be transported from our Bangkok location by us at no additional charge. For food and berverage, we can add two more components to both make the spread more visually stunning and expand the range of flavors. These are the prawn tower for 7,000++ and a Foie gras selection for 25,000++. Along with the already existing BBQ menu, this is sure to please even the most particular palates of all your guests. We would like to invite you to a tasting so you can test the food yourself; let me know when you will be free and we can arrange it. In the meantime, please see the attached menu to make sure that everything is still to your liking. If you have any questions or feedback regarding any of this, please do not hesitate to reach out. I look forward to hearing from you. Should any further assistance be required, please contact us at your convenience.

Hi Bier,
Thank you for your prompt response.
- Thank you for confirming about the florist, we will coordinate with them on Friday to determine when we will pick up the bouquets/boutineers/corsages for the day of the event.
- We would like the cake below with a hexagon shape that's simple with some fresh flowers in our wedding colors and our Hello Kitty cake topper
If possible, please use the following colors for the decoration.
- We will be bringing this cake topper with dimensions: weight 0.77kg (1.7lbs) and is 7.62cm/10.92cm/7.11cm.
- For the wine, we would like you to provide the bottles. If you have a list of available wines and prices please forward to me. I think initially we said 10 bottles of red and 10 bottles of white, but now we are thinking more along the lines of 7 bottles of red and 7 bottles of white on the tables, with the remaining credit to go to the bar for cocktails.
- If possible, we'd like to do signature cocktails for the Bride and Groom. Please let me know if you are able to find the below ingredients (other than the Grey Goose, the other ingredients do not have to be that specific brand), if not I can provide an alternate cocktail.
Bride - Rock N Rolla 1.5 oz Old Grand-Dad Bourbon 100pf.1 oz apple juice0.75 oz lemon juice0.5 oz grade B maple syrup0.25 oz St. Elizabeth Allspice Dram2 big dashes angostura bittersBriskly shake with ice and strain into old fashioned glass with fresh iceGrate nutmeg on topGroom - Grey Goose Dirty Martini

Also, if you can find these ingredients for Negronis, that would also be wonderful
St. George Gin (maybe Beefeater or Tanqueray)CampariAntica Formula (Vermouth)I'm attaching a schedule for Friday Night and Saturday so you can plan accordingly.
- We would like to do a tea ceremony before the rehearsal (before 5 pm)  on Friday night on the pool deck (maybe lounge). Would you be able to provide a tea pot and some tea cups at this time?
- On Saturday, could you provide a decorated table with fresh flowers for signing in guests near the ceremony area?
- After the ceremony, we'd like the sound system/speakers moved up to the pool deck, and if possible placed in an area where we can still hear music/speeches on the beach/dining area during dinner. The projector and screen should likewise be set up on the pool deck.
- We'd like the prawn tower and foie gras on the pool deck for cocktail hour after the ceremony.
- We'd like to do the sky lanterns (20) on the beach at 9 PM after dinner and before guests move up to the pool deck for cake and dessert and the rest of the activities.
- We will need 2 champagne flutes/glasses and a cake knife by the cake.
Thank you for your kind attention to these details. If you have any additional questions, please let me know. Katie and I will be leaving San Francisco on Thursday morning 3/12 at 12:30AM and will be in Hong Kong until Sunday March 15. During this time we may not respond to email right away until we reach Bangkok on Monday 3/16 at noon.
Thank YouTony and Katie
Dear Katy and Tony,
We will most certainly be able to provide a basket for your programs, box and matches for sparklers, and flowers for Katie's hair. It is also no problem to cut the cake on the pool deck, with dessert set up nearby. Thank you for letting us know about these details. As for the florist, he will be arriving on the morning of March 20 and spending the whole day making the arrangements, so you will be able to see them that evening or the following morning.
I have one more question:
For red and white wine you would like us to provide for you or you will bring by your own?
Warm regards,Bier

Dear Katy and Tony,
My name is Bier, we had talking about your wedding long time a go. I would like to inform you that I will be center between your side and Hansar side since now until end of your wedding. Please do not hesitate to contact me should you have any questions. My email is .
May I asking you about the wedding cake. I attached 2 pictures of wedding cake as below. Which one you're prefer or some advise.

And just a few more logistical questions from our end:Towards the beginning of the conversation, you were asking about the traditional sky lanterns, is this still a detail you are interested in?Is there anything special you would like us to arrange for your guests' arrivals, outside of our customary welcome (non alcoholic) drink and cold towel? In addition, it would be greatly appreciated if you could send a guest list and preferred seating. Using this, we will print up name cards to arrange on the tables on the day of the ceremony.Do your guests have any sort of favorite drink? We are currently reviewing our inventory and would like to know if there is anything we should stock up on. Lastly, do you have a copy of the schedule for the wedding night? Also, do you have any specific agenda you are planning on having your guests follow for any other part of the rest of the stay? If not, I have attached a list of things to do nearby that they may be interested in. We can talk about group pricing if you think anything sounds particularly like they would enjoy. If so, can you send it over so we can plan accordingly? Thank you so much, and I look forward to hearing from you.​Yours Sincerely, Kanitta Jatutain (Nana) |  Reservations & Revenue Manager, Bangkok HANSAR HOTELS & RESORTS |  Bangkok  |  Koh Samui  |  Pranburi

I am currently in Lebanon, Beirut & Saida, working a little bit but not too hard. Flu gone in time. And on the evening I had time to celebrate with a nice colleague and some old German friends who live in Beirut now. Wonderful Lebanese food and a good wine,
perfect. But the proper party will be in June, I will inform you about the exact date later.

Hello,
Donald did some research on some places around Thailand that we might be able to stay at the week after the wedding. Can you take a look at the links below
and let us know your thoughts? Were looking for somewhere with good activities for the family, including Maddie. Nothing too adventurous. Just low key like a beach, some place with animals, etc.
Thanks,

Hi Jenny,
All look good to me. Just you need to book flights too. I heard from your mom that Tony & Katie also have interest to stay in Koh Samui after the wedding.
Let me know your final plan so I know whether you need the crib or not. It could be difficult to fix but Donald will find the way. I have to borrow it from a friend.
Thanks!

Dear Jenny, Donald & Maddie,
I am sorry for not responding to your last mail. As you know from last time, it's a deal between us that you can stay at our place wherever. You are most welcome. By the time you are here, we will have another place ready for guests on sukhumvit rd. not sure which one you like most. I also offered to uncle Pravit if he wants to stay inner city alone, but I am not sure See-E will allow him... Haha.
As you see on the airbnb site the space is rather narrow. Can you show us the crib you want for Maddie so we can figure out how it works? Airbnb is not for you to book. You are our special guests.
Other things like pampers, children food etc. I think there are available. Feel free to ask more.
Should we have line so we can contact easier?
Hugs,
Dew Jeh
Sent from my iPhone
I mean the line where we can write and talk to each other or send photos, not via email. I have lately used this way of contact with Tony and your mom. I can take more photos of the baby shelf here so you know what's available here.
I will have a look and see how to fix the crib in the room.
Thanks for the response. Not sure what you mean by having a line so we can contact easier? Do you mean talk on the phone?
As for a crib, something like this:

Or any kind of crib will work.

Hello Jenny,
Mom asked me to send over the detail of the condo.
We list the room on airbnb so here's the link to all details and photos: 
It's by the river and walkable distance from BTS sky train. It's 7 stops away from siam center.
Not sure about the crib - mom please let her know.
And diapers - yes there are those brands here.
Let both of us know if you have other questions!

1. Hansar - We requested to see how the tables for dinner will be laid out so we can start planning a seating chart, but the hotel doesn't seem to understand what we need or can provide one to us. Do you think you can contact them to see if they can send it to us?
2. Scala - I'm trying to get a final headcount to see how many people will be coming to dinner. Right now I have 20 people, but it may end up being closer to 30. Can you check to see if they can accommodate a party this size and if we need to do anything to reserve the tables (put down a deposit etc). We hope you and P Wiworn will be able to join just for this dinner as well.
3. Transportation between Bangkok/Pranburi - It's looking like the majority of our guests will need ground transportation to/from Bangkok and Pranburi. We will most likely need to rent that 40+ person bus. The schedule will be19March Around Noon or 1PM - Pick up at Renaissance Hotel, Drop Off at Brassiere and Drop Off at Hansar21March Around 11AM or Noon - Pick Up at Hansar, Pick Up at Brassiere, Drop Off at BKK Airport
You previously sent us this link for the bus company  and said it would cost 24,0000B. I also found two other companies  and 
Would it be possible for you to see how what the cost for the roundtrip is for these companies as well as the one you provided?
4. Sparklers - We would like to give our guests some sparklers for before dinner so that they can wave them when Katie and I come in. Are these available for sale in Thailand and how much do they cost?
5. Welcome Bag - Katie and I are putting together a welcome bag for our guests to be handed out at Brassiere and Hansar. We would like to include the following items:
MintsBandaidsPepto Bismol – for stomach achesZantac – for acid reducerAdvil – for pain relieveAloe Vera gelSunblockAfter Bite – bug bite itch relief
Citron
and for the bolded ones, that specific brand. Can you confirm that these are all available for purchase in Thailand so we don't need to buy them in the US and bring them with us?
6. Rehearsal Dinner - Katie found this restaurant called Thai Thai to have dinner after the Wedding Rehearsal on Friday night. We need to know how many people the restaurant can hold as it looks like as many as 50 people will be coming to dinner. If it is a small place, we may need to book out the whole place. We are planning to do dinner around 6PM or 6:30PM. Also need to confirm if they accept credit cards. Would you be able to contact them for us with the questions we have? They don't have a phone number posted and not sure if Hansar would know.

7. Photographer/Videographer - Thank you for putting down the deposit. Can you let me know how/when they expect to be paid the balance. Should we provide a credit card when get to Thailand for them to charge or will they be expecting cash on the day of the wedding?
THANK YOU again for all your help!
Love, Tony and Katie
Hi,
Uncle Prasong called me today that your mom was sending an invitation card to us and it's at his place.
I got excited and would like to be sure that everything is well prepared. Did I miss anything since the below mail? Has the new coordinator (Bier) answered all your requests and all things are confirmed? Hoping not to spend too much on the items which are not quite clear or necessary.
Just to remind you that you can always have my service. We are in the family.
love,
Dew Jeh

Dear Tony & Katie,
My name is Bier, I'd
just like to introduce myself because I will be your new point of contact for
all your wedding arrangements instead of Wallop. I just want you to know that
I'll be here for anything you need, so please don't hesitate to ask. This is
mostly just a greeting email to let you know that I'm very excited to start
working with you as we make sure your big day is absolutely perfect.
·  How
will the tables be set? Is there a diagram you can send?
Because Pranburi is a relatively new property, we do not have a
diagram for the table set up. However, we can assure you that your party will
fit comfortably in our facilities, and I have attached a floor plan so you can
at least get a sense of the property layout. We will be making a table diagram
in the near future, and will send it to you as soon as we are able.
·  How
much will it be to set wines bottles (red & white) at each table and pay as
we go with other drinks (beer and cocktails)?
o Scotch is the same price as Vodka? What kind
of labels do you have?
As far as liquor goes, we charge 1000++ per wine bottle and
150++ per beer or cocktail on an a la carte basis. Most people, however, opt
for the open bar package because it allows for the greatest flexibility and value.
Our scotch and vodka are the same price, and the standards are Johnny Walker
Black Label and Smirnoff, respectively. If you prefer different brands or
varieties, we are most certainly able to arrange it.
·  Prawn
Tower 7000 THB - How many pieces/people will it serve?
o Enough for 60 guest as an appetizer after
ceremony/before dinner?
·  Foie
Gras 25,000 THB -  How many pieces/people will it serve?
o Enough for 60 guest as an appetizer after
ceremony/before dinner?
The prawn tower and foie
gras will yield about two pieces per guest each. You know your guests better
than we do, so this may be perfect for them.
A second option you may
want to consider is a pass-around canapé selection, which runs at 30000++. We
can propose a lovely selection of dishes that include foie gras and prawns,
tuna tartar, and more.
·  Fresh
Flowers for Ceremony at 20,000 THB -
o As Displayed in Attached Pictures
o 8 Bridesmaids Bouquets
o 2 Flower Girl Bouquets
o 12 Boutonnieres for Groomsmen/Family
Please let me check with my florist team about
flowers cost that you mention. I will let you know as soon as possible.
·  Sound
System 65,000 THB - confirmed
o To be used during Ceremony and at
Dinner/Banquet
o At least 2 Microphones
o Speakers
o Cables to Hook up Laptop for Music
o Keyboard
·  Projection
20,000 THB -  confirmed
o To be used at Dinner/Banquet Only
o Projector
o Large Screen to Display
o Cables to Hook Up Laptop
o VGA Cables
Warm regards,
Bier.

Hi Joe,
Thank you again for your response. See most of our my response in PURPLE below
Below is the image of the Hello Kitty cake topper I had in mind. It weighs 0.77kg (1.7lbs) and is 7.62cm/10.92cm/7.11cm. Let me know if it will not fit the top tier of the cake. The cake from your image is very pretty.
Another note - the colors to our wedding are Peach, Mint and Gold. If flowers will be in the color scheme, that would be great! If not possible, we can settle to use white and yellow.

Hi Joe,
Thanks for your time with the response. My additional
questions and comments are in PURPLE. Let me
know if there is a good time in the morning to call you as it may be easier to
prevent questions/answers from being lost in translation.

Dear
Tony & Katie,
Greetings!
Thank you once again for the enquiries for the wedding. Henceforth, I will be
directly in-charge of your wedding preparations, so kindly direct your mails
and queries to me. I will ensure that all the questions will be answered and it
is my great pleasure to be able to serve as your wedding coordinator.
For
all your queries, please find our response in red. In case if we are not clear
enough, please kindly let us know for further explanation.
1.    Will you be able to act as
our day of coordinator for the day of the wedding? Is there an extra charge for
this, if yes, how much? Some staff will identified and be pre-assigned to stand by on the
wedding day. This will be a compliments and we will not be charging for it. Will
you be there that day and if not, is there one person whom I can go to that
will lead the efforts and I can go to?
2.    How can our
guests book the 16 rooms (minus our Honeymoon room) at the Hansar hotel? How
many extra beds in total do you have at Hansar Pranburi for additional guests
in rooms? At present there
is only 5 rooms left un-booked in the resort and the rates will be offered at
the same rate as in contract (5,000 Bath net inclusive of ABF). Extra beds can
be arranged but please let us know the how many would be required. The charge
for 2,000 baht will be charged for the extra person. Besides our party (we pre-booked 10 rooms + honeymoon suite
partially provided), is there another room booked by someone not part of our
group? We want to ensure the entire resort is saved for our party for 3 nights
from 19-22 March 2015. We need 6 extra beds.
3.    Questions about flowers: How
much will it cost to have the flowers similar to the
"Wedding Flower Details" from your website
because we love the flower arch from the wedding pictures. As per
the quotation done by K. Churaporn is 120,000 Bath. The wedding package
includes Floral Decoration, welcome drinks, celebration Toast, 3 tier wedding
cake and decorative wedding certificate. An additional 20,000 Bath will be
required to buy fresh flower if you prefer as shown in the attached files.
Please do let us know in advance so that we can arrange for the fresh flowers.
Great, we love the florist who arranged the flowers from your
wedding page on your hotel website. Additional 20,000 Baht is ok for more fresh
flowers I want/need.
4.      What are the 6 flower displays
on bamboo stands? do you have a picture? Please
see the pictures attached. Got it.
5.      What are the 12 floral fire
torches? do you have pictures? we only saw hanging lanterns from some pictures.
How much more would the following cost?
·
8 bridesmaid bouquets
·
2 small bouquets for flower girls
·
12 groomsmen/family boutonniere/corsage (how much for each if we want to order
more for family?) All these can be arranged. However, as informed earlier an
additional 20,000 baht will be required besides the quotation. Great,
we are fine with the price.
6.   What is the welcome drink and
when will it be served on arrival? The
welcome drink will be served as soon as the guest arrives. It will be a fruit
punch or Thai herbal drink will be arrange with free of charge. Please let us
know if you have any other preferences. The fruit punch and herbal
drink sounds good. Please ensure it isn't too sweet since I don't know what to
expect.
Arrival
when checking into hotel or arrival before the start of the wedding ceremony? Can be
serve both upon c/in and before the wedding ceremony for fruit punch and Thai
herb drink. If you prefer champagne, it can be served at 300 baht per person
and for Prosecco 150 baht per person.  Just
the fruit punch and Thai herb drink sounds great upon c/in and before the
wedding ceremony. Champagne and Prosecco not necessary since we plan to have
open bar for our guests who drink after the ceremony.
8.  Will Hansar provide the cake cutter/knife
and 2 champagne glasses for the celebration toast? Yes, this
will be arranged for you. Great
How many will the 3 tier wedding cake feed? This cake
can feed about 100 peoples. More than enough.
10.  How will it be decorated? Please
see file attached and let us know your preferences. We
did not see the attached file of the decorated cake.
11.   Is it large enough at the top tier to add a cake
topper like this Hello Kitty one? This can
be done. Please let us know the purpose ( is it for decoration?) of this so
that we can arrange. Yes, this is to decorate the cake at the very top tier. The size
of this porcelain figurine is 7.62 cm H X 10.92 cm W X 7.11 cm D
12.   How much will it cost for additional Fire Lantern
for our guests who would like to light them? The cost
for each will be 150 baht. Please prepare have an additional 20 for
our guests.
13.
We've decided to go with the Beach Side Dinner Buffet with Barbeque for our
wedding dinner reception for 55-60 guests. This is a
great idea! We can provide bbq buffet dinner with 2800++ per person for the
wedding. There will be 4 children. Are they charged the same as adults
for the buffet dinner? We are interested in adding 2 items from the cocktail
menu to be served right after the ceremony, before start of buffet dinner. - 1.
Prawn Tower for $7,000 TBH and 2. Foie Gras pan fried with fig
compote and fruit reductions, butter brioche. What is the cost of the Foie
Gras?
14.  When do you need the final headcount by? Just let
us know 10 days in advance before wedding date. Great.
15.  How are kids charged? We have 4 children
in the following ages: 1, 2, 4, and 14 years old. We would like to provide bar
service for our guest but half of them will not drink alcohol and it isn't
worth it to pay 2,000 THB per person for everyone. If possible, please let us know number of people for the
drink session so that we can arrange a special price. 35 will be drinking. What is your special price?
16.  How much are individual drinks? Possible
to let us know number so that we can arrange 35 people
17.
Is it an option to pay for only those who would need open bar? It would
be good if you can let us know the number of people who will be using the Bar,
then we will come out with the minimum charge as mentioned earlier. 35
people
18.  Would we be able to set up a sound system for the
ceremony? for the ceremony, we would like:
·
a mic for the Officiate and passing it to the bride and groom during speech
·
speakers for the mic
·
cables to hook up a mp3 player or laptop for music
·
for the cost of 65,000 THB for the Sound System and Music Instruments, does
that come with DJ and live musicians? Yes we
will set up sound system as requested. A DJ can provided and would cost 65,000
baht. For the live musicians if you prefer, we can arrange. Please let us know
what kind of band do you prefer and kind of songs too. This will be charged
separately from 65,000 baht and the cost will depend on which band of your
choice. If we only need the sound system as requested (microphones and
connections for MP3 & laptop for music through speakers and NOT the
DJ or live musicians, is there extra cost? We would like to display a wedding
slideshow. Is there extra cost for the projector, screen and VGA cables?
19.  Do you have recommendations for nearby restaurants in the
area for our large group? We are planning a rehearsal dinner and wanted to try
another cuisine style outside of your resort. Yes,
there are some good Thai cuisine and seas food restaurants nearby the hotel. Do
you have the names of the restaurants and do they have websites or phone
numbers?
20.  Are taxi or other transportation hard to get for guests
staying 15 minutes away? Transportation can be arranged for the guests provided you let us
know for how many guests in advance. Is there a transportation
company you would recommend? If yes, can you provide their contact
information?
ADDITIONAL QUESTION: if we book our 3 nights Bangkok stay
at Hansar Bangkok, can you offer my guests a discount? If yes, how much for about
20 rooms. Would you provide the transportation to Hansar Pranburi?
In addition, we can also provide make- up artist and hair
dressers if you require. My make-up artist is one of my bridesmaid so I'm set. Thank you
for asking.
Thank
you once again and best wishes
Wallop

I forgot to mention dinner is at Soul Food Mahanakkorn at 7pm. Feel free to check out their menu on the website.
Hi ladies,
Since we're almost 2 months out, I want to make sure you are aware of my plans for a ladies day (Bachelorette) in Bangkok. I know some of you will not make it due to other travels, but please let me know if you'll be there, so my Maid of Honor, Sherry, can ensure you're accounted for.
Below is the schedule for the day. We'll have drinks (one drink for me) after dinner but location TBD. Let me know if you have questions or only want to join for part of the day.
Currently, I have the follow ladies joining me for the day:
JennyChuraiporn Kalissa (hotel after dinner)Kit Ching (hotel after dinner)Shui Kit (hotel after dinner)VivianAdaSherryAnnieKatherineKimberlyWianaRebecca
Dear Roswitha,
so glad hearing from you. I think I wrote to you at another mail address. Somehow we missed our contacts several times. I heard the phone but I could not get it in time. I was guessing it was you.I give you again my new mobile phone no.: 083-815-7616 so we may be able to reach each other better.
We are glad hearing you had a wonderful Christmas gathering. No wonder all the family members love to join you. You always have special ways in treating people warmly. Remembering in the old days you are the one who provided a lot of treats for the us. We still remember our one day trip to Kaukenhof in Netherlands and some more places in Germany. We enjoyed your preparation of a lot of sweets and treats.
Wipi and Peson were around but Peson had to go back to work in the States before Christmas. Anyway, we treasured the good time together.
The same here, we had a quiet New Year celebration, only on the New Year Eve we experienced the fireworks on the 40th floor of our small condominium on the river. But last week the weather in Bangkok was really nice cool and sunny. We would really love to send you some.
We wish you blessings, healthy and fit for the year of 2015.
take care and lots of love,
Chu, Wiworn, Peson & Wipi
Dear Chu and family,
a bit late but still all the best for the New Year. May all your wishes come true.
I tried to phone you Christmas day and New Year but did not have any luck. I reached an answering phone but was not sure whether it was yours so I did not leave a message. I hope that you are all doing well and that life is treating you fine.
Did you have a nice Christmas? I had all my family here to celebrate Christmas day. You know my living room. It was really crowded but I did enjoy it. The family seems to get bigger by the year. Before I thought when my nephews were grown up they would do their own thing. But instead they are coming now with wife and girlfriend. I do enjoy it having all the young people around me. The only unfortunate thing is that you feel really old among them. New Years I spent at home. So it was a very quiet start. Did not even have a glass of champaign because I forgot to buy it.
Now winter has started. Yesterday we had snow. I hope it does not stay too long. I heard from Harry that it is really warm around your way. It would be nice if you could send some sunshine.
All the best for you all - take care of yourselves
lots of love Roswitha
Dear Roswitha, We wish you as good start for the coming year 2015, full of blessings and good health.
How is life? We miss you and hope to see you some day.
take care,
lots of love & hugs,
Chu, Wiworn, Peson & Wipi P.S. Peson is now in Boston, working with a company called CVS in Rhode Island. Wipi is at home in Bangkok. We two, are still working at our company. Hope to hear from you also.
My dear Anita,
Wishing you a good start for the year 2015. It's quite a good idea to start with holidays.
We hope that Heinz and Elke could join you for a visit to Thailand next year. (have already the date?) We really look forward to.
Our best regards also to Elizabeth and family,
You, lots of fun and relax in Mexico.
Best regards and happy New Year to all our friends in Erlensee!
lots of love & hugs,
Chu, Wiworn, Peson & Wipi
My dear Chu,
I hope you all had a wonderful Christmas season.
Now it is already time to wish you a good start into 2015! I will be packing my suitcase tomorrow, have a very small celebration at midnight and on day 1 my
plane will take off to Mexico!!!
In time before leaving - two days ago - winter started here with bloody cold and a lot of snow, so ist really good to go to the golf of Mexico. By the way,
you know I plan to come to Thailand next year and I will give Heinz and Elke another chance to join me (Roswitha cannot go in Dez/Jan unfortunately). So I gave them mid of February as a deadline to decide. Heinz is convinced, only Elke is still thinking -
the kids both support the idea and Ochsi can survive too so lets hope for the (their) best.
Good wishes for you and the whole family for the New Year!!!
Loads of love, hugs and kisses,
Anita

How about this for a message:
Congratulations to the Class of 2015 on graduating today from one of Thailand's outstanding schools. And double congratulations to the recipient of the Blanford award for being the best of the best!  You have worked hard, you have persevered, and you have achieved a significant milestone in your life. Education is one of the best investments you can make as you prepare for the future.
Did you know that a good education means more than acquiring knowledge? As a well-educated person, you know how to apply knowledge so that you live a good life, making wise choices.  Wisdom means that you make right choices based on the knowledge you have. And wisdom does not come from just sitting in a classroom or from studying books. How do we get wisdom?
The Bible tells us that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. How does that work?  Sometimes if we think that we can get away with something, we may end up making a bad choice.  But when we fear the Lord, we know that we are accountable to Him for everything we think, say, and do.  He sees us all the time, and He knows our motives.
If I am in a position of authority, for instance, I may be tempted to take a bribe - especially if I think no one will know, or if I tell myself that everyone else is doing it.  But when I fear God, I know that I will have to answer to Him. That awareness gives me great incentive to resist the temptation! God Himself will reward me for doing right, and will discipline me for doing wrong.
So as you finish one chapter of your life and are ready to embark on the next, I challenge you to make the best use of your first-class education. Pursue wisdom - get to know the God who made you, the One who gave you the the will to study and the sharp mind to learn. Make wise choices knowing that He wants what is best for you. If you honor Him, He will honor you.  God bless you.
Rev. Mark Blanford, Ph.D.
PS. I have attached a couple of photos from which you may choose.  Or if none of these work, let me know and I will try to find something better.
Thank you for your response.  And we want you to know that the school your father started, received a citation from the princess being an outstanding school.  The average scores of our students are in the top 10 percent of the country.  Right now we are planning on building another building to accommodate the growth that is happening in the last few years.  Please come and visit us.
By the way, with your message, would love to have a picture of Charlotte and you and the family if possible.
Blessings,
Charn

FYI

"Dubbed "theMIT Media Lab's artier cousin" by Wired, the program and its students are increasingly lauded as one of the more creative and forward-thinking forces in the tech industry."
"It's not that I think graduate school is never a good thing for people. It's that I really want them to understand there are paths to learning without it," explains Stark, who herself twice dropped out of a Yale graduate program. She holds an MA pro forma for completing two years of coursework but left before earning her Ph.D. "If you have some kind of financial support to get there, whether it's a fellowship or your parents, I'd say go for it."

Hi Dew Jeh,

Will all the photographs and videos be provided to us on all as digital files so we can print it ourselves?Just want to make sure to see if they are printing any photographs or creating DVDs for us.

Dear
Chu,
hope everything is
ok at your end.
Finally, medico
booked the flight for me from October 13 to October 27, 2014. It has to do with
the price and conference dates in Palestina, well, cannot be
changed.
Did you hear more
about Wipi's travel plans?
My colleague Laila
is here with me now, work was finished today and now we have a week of fun.
Tomorrow we go along the river Rhein and next week we go for a short trip to
Paris. I am back/she will leave on Sep 25.
Will get in touch
after that.
Hugs &
kisses,
Anita
keep it for your file.
I got it from your room to register you for receiving mileage from our TG account.

I will wait till tomorrow how they are going to answer me. I suggest 2 options:
1. 1 Direct Deposit and 1 Bill Payment per statement cycle (which is difficult for you I think since you don't really have anything to do with this bank.)
2. $1,500 in combined average monthly balances in checking (our joint current acc.)  I will put this amount there to avoid 10$ monthly charge. If you really decide nothing to do with this account you may close it and use that amount to buy ticket home.
dee mai. you choose!
Wait till tomorrow.
The credit card you perhaps should apply at BA since you got your income/expenses there.
which one you need? Hope it's enough.

by the way, in your new uscis doc. you are no more mentioning this below paragraph:
The primary reason that I was physically absent from the
United States for over 6 months but less than a year in 2009 was I went back to
Thailand to finish my high school (Graduated March 2009) and when receiving an
acceptance at UC Davis, I prepared and moved back to the United States to
continue my education.
I hope that I have prepared a substantial amount of documents and
explanation for the need to prove my continuity of residency
Is it intentionally not talking about your return to finish your high school ? ถ้าจะบอกเหตุผลนี้ ควรเอา (Graduated March 2009) ออก เพราะเค้าคงคิดว่าแล้วทำไมไม่รีบกลับไปอเมริกา

Your mother is not a U.S. citizen and has no U.S. income, so she is not a taxpayer. Your children are not your qualifying children because they do not meet the residency test. But since they are not the qualifying children of any other taxpayer, they are your qualifying relatives and you can claim them as dependents. You may also be able to claim your mother as a dependent if the gross income and support tests are met.Member of Household or Relationship TestTo meet this test, a person must either:Live with you all year as a member of your household, orBe related to you in one of the ways listed under Relatives who do not have to live with you .If at any time during the year the person was your spouse, that person cannot be your qualifying relative. However, see Personal Exemptions , earlier.Relatives who do not have to live with you.   A person related to you in any of the following ways does not have to live with you all year as a member of your household to meet this test.Your child, stepchild, foster child, or a descendant of any of them (for example, your grandchild).

Again Section 316.5(c) (1) (i) states thus The types of documentation which may establish that the applicant did not disrupt the continuity of his or her residence in the United States during an extended absence include, but are not limited to, evidence that during the absence:The applicant did not terminate his or her employment in the United States;The applicants immediate family remained in the United States;The applicant retained full access to his or her United States abode; orThe applicant did not obtain employment while abroad.It can be gathered in the above provision of the CFR that in order that you can prove you did not disrupt your continuous residence in the United States is that you did not commit acts that may be construed as an intent to reside elsewhere.Those acts could be if you resigned from your work and then you brought your family to another country and you enrolled your children to school there and then you and your wife looked and found worked in that foreign country.Mean while you either gave up your apartment in the U.S. or you listed your house to be sold then I would like to believe that should you have a change of heart after 9 months and decide to return to the U.S. there is no doubt in my mind that you will not be able to overcome the presumption that you disrupted your continuous residence.You may not have lost your status as an LPR but your residence for purposes of applying for U.S. Citizenship or Naturalization will definitely be delayed.So when can you apply for Naturalization if your continuous residence was disrupted?8 CFR Section 316.5(c)(1)(ii) states thus An applicant  who must satisfy a five year statutory residence period may file an application for naturalization four years and one day following the date of applicants return to the United States to resume permanent residence. An applicant  who must satisfy a three year statutory residence period may file an application fro naturalization two years and one day following the date of the applicants return to the United States to resume permanent residence.The above section presupposes that the LPR left the U.S. for 1 year or more to have disrupted their continuous residence, this requirement presumably applies to those who left for over 6 months and returned in less than 1 year but failed to satisfy the USCIS that their continuous residence was not disrupted, because this provision prescribes the requirement for those whose continuous residence has been disrupted.So the waiting time upon return is 4 years and 1 day for those with 5 year residency requirement and 2 years and 1 day for those with 3 years residency requirement. Active military service in time of hostilities needs to wait only 1 year before they can apply for U.S. Citizenship, but 3 years in time of peace.In order to avoid having to prove to the USCIS that your continuous residence was not disrupted because you left the U.S. for less than 1 year but over 6 months, limit your travels outside of the U.S. for less than 6 months each time you leave.

good explanation! I thought about it also.
do you think you have letter of acceptance somewhere at Mah's place?
Gim Ri can help searching for you.
Can you say this?
You went back to Thailand to finish
your High School and when receiving an acceptance at UC Davis you prepared
and moved back to US to study.

FW: more to read
I am not sure whether there is any letter
from UC Davis to show your address. Will it be a problem if it's not Peson's
address?
Not sure he really claimed Wip as dependent
.. (is it e-file? or how?)
Again Section 316.5(c) (1)
(i) states thus The types of documentation which may establish that
the applicant did not disrupt the continuity of his or her residence in
the United States during an extended absence include, but are not limited
to, evidence that during the absence:
The applicant did not terminate
his or her employment in the United States;
The applicants immediate
family remained in the United States;
The applicant retained full
access to his or her United States abode; or
The applicant did not obtain
employment while abroad.
It can be gathered in the
above provision of the CFR that in order that you can prove you did not
disrupt your continuous residence in the United States is that you did
not commit acts that may be construed as an intent to reside elsewhere.
Those acts could be if you
resigned from your work and then you brought your family to another country
and you enrolled your children to school there and then you and your wife
looked and found worked in that foreign country.
Mean while you either gave
up your apartment in the U.S. or you listed your house to be sold then
I would like to believe that should you have a change of heart after 9
months and decide to return to the U.S. there is no doubt in my mind that
you will not be able to overcome the presumption that you disrupted your
continuous residence.
You may not have lost your
status as an LPR but your residence for purposes of applying for U.S. Citizenship
or Naturalization will definitely be delayed.
So when can you apply for
Naturalization if your continuous residence was disrupted?
8 CFR Section 316.5(c)(1)(ii)
states thus An applicant  who must satisfy a five year statutory
residence period may file an application for naturalization four years
and one day following the date of applicants return to the United States
to resume permanent residence. An applicant  who must satisfy a three
year statutory residence period may file an application fro naturalization
two years and one day following
the date of the applicants return to the United States to resume permanent
residence.
The above section presupposes
that the LPR left the U.S. for 1 year or more to have disrupted their continuous
residence, this requirement presumably applies to those who left for over
6 months and returned in less than 1 year but failed to satisfy the USCIS
that their continuous residence was not disrupted, because this provision
prescribes the requirement for those whose continuous residence has been
disrupted.
So the waiting time upon
return is 4 years and 1 day for those with 5 year residency requirement
and 2 years and 1 day
for those with 3 years residency requirement. Active military service in
time of hostilities needs to wait only 1 year before they can apply for
U.S. Citizenship, but 3 years in time of peace.
In order to avoid having
to prove to the USCIS that your continuous residence was not disrupted
because you left the U.S. for less than 1 year but over 6 months, limit
your travels outside of the U.S. for less than 6 months each time you leave.
That way your continuous residency will not be a problem when you apply
for naturalization.
Consult an attorney to find
out if you satisfy the rest of the naturalization requirements so you can
apply soonest.

What Disrupts Continuous ResidenceAbsence Between 6 months and 1 year (not cumulative, but on at least one trip)An absence between 6 months and 1 year may disrupt the continuity of residence. Thats why a lot of people with ties in their home country take 5 month / 3 week trips or anything short of 6 months. If you travel for over 6 months (but less than a year) at one time, there is a rebuttable presumption" of disruption of the continual residence. However, as long as you prove that you still have employment, residency, immediate family etc. in the U.S., then even if you travel for over 6 months in one time (still less than 1 year) you should be fine.Note that this is per trip and not a cumulative requirement. So you can still have several trips totaling over 6 months or over 1 year. As long as no single trip is over 6 months, there wont be a rebuttable presumption of disruption of the continuity of residence.

Beginning Monday, April 23, the Daily News and the City University of New York will hold our 10th annual CUNY/Daily News Citizenship Now! call-in. Since the call-in began, we have answered almost 98,000 of your questions. This year, that number will surpass 100,000. The call-in is an opportunity for readers to get the information they need to become a U.S. citizen, permanent resident or get other immigration benefits.More than 400 attorneys, government-accredited paralegals and trained community advocates will staff the call-in. If after speaking to an advocate you think you qualify for a benefit, the advocate will refer you to someone who can help you complete the necessary forms. The call-in will run from April 23 to April 27, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m with separate phone lines for English and Spanish callers. We will have available speakers of dozens of other languages as well. Besides the Daily News and CUNY, this years sponsors include media partner Univision, and sponsors Cisco, the American Immigration Lawyers Association, the Legal Aid Society, Gristedes, WADO 1280 AM, La Que Buena 92.7 and BlueWater, a Presidio Company.Youll find the call-in phone numbers in the April 23 Daily News.Meanwhile, to prepare you for the call-in, over the next few weeks, Ill answer some common questions about citizenship and immigration law. We start our discussion with the rules for naturalizing  the process where a permanent resident becomes a U.S. citizen. Today we discuss the continuous residence requirement for U.S. citizenship.Q. How long must I be a permanent resident to qualify to naturalize?A. Most naturalization applicants must have been a continuous resident for at least five years. The requirement is three years if you have been married to, and living with, the same U.S. citizen for the last three years while a permanent resident. You may file your application three months before you meet the five (or three) years of permanent residence. Special rules apply to veterans and members of the military. Ѥ.If you came here as a refugee, your permanent residence date should be backdated to the day you arrived in the United States. If you were an asylee, it should be backdated on year. So, refugees count permanent residence since their day of entry, asylees one year from before the date the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service granted them permanent residence.Continuous residence means you never abandoned your U.S. residence. If you have been abroad for a continuous period of more than six months, the USCIS may contest your continuous residence. Still, even after more than six months abroad, if you can prove that your primary residence was in the U.S., you should be able to show continuous residence. So for instance, if you were studying abroad, you would bring a school transcript to your interview. If you were taking care of a sick relative, you would bring a letter from a doctor. If you were simply vacationing, bring proof that you maintained a residence in the U.S. That proof might include a bank account, credit card account, proof that you returned to a job you had before you left, or an apartment lease.  credit card ... transcript ç¹ ѹ˹  Ҩ.uc Һҹѡҡ˹ չAfter one continuous year or more abroad, you need either a reentry permit issued by the USCIS or a special immigrant visa issued by a U.S. consul abroad to return. Note that in most cases, if you have been abroad for more than 365 continuous days, even with USCIS permission, with limited exceptions, that will break your period of continuous residence.If you entered after more than a year abroad with your permanent resident card only, but the immigration inspector didnt realize that you had been abroad so long, a USCIS naturalization examiner will nevertheless consider you to have abandoned your residence. If you were abroad for more than a year without USCIS permission, speak to an immigration law expert before applying to naturalize. Youll want to make sure you have a current claim to permanent residence. Otherwise, you risk being deported.The law exempts certain business travelers, religious workers, government employees, researchers for a U.S. research agency, seamen and women and members of the military from the continuous residence requirement.If you are abroad for less than six continuous months, to deny you naturalization, USCIS would need to prove that you had abandoned your residence. So, trips abroad of six months or less, are rarely a problem. Thats true even if those trips were often and lengthy. Further, USCIS is most concerned about recent trips. Trips many years ago of less than one year, even though longer than six months, arent normally a problem with most naturalization examiners. ԧMembers of the military serving during wartime qualify to naturalize without regard to the continuous residence requirement. Based on an order signed byPresident Bush in 2002, those serving on Sept. 11, 2001 and after, until a U.S. President ends the program, benefit from this rule. PROMOTED STORIES

I can have a look.
I read in one of the comments that a letter with my name on it sent to me during that period of time is fine too.
May be if I can find the letter of acceptance from ucdavis sent to me to gu luck's place it will be sufficient. Because that came in March 2009. Or any letter of those kinds from Davis. But all of those are buried somewhere in LA.
Those attending my workshops want to know what will count as
evidence. School records are very good, as are any official documents,
including, oddly enough, arrest records. With school records,
transcripts for several years will prove your presence here. Two of my
favorite proofs are a birth certificate for your child born here or a
marriage certificate. Medical records are very good proofs, as well.
Tax records, bank records, and even utility bills and collection
notices are helpful. Envelopes with postmarks might be accepted as well
as leases, credit card receipts, and purchase orders. Often overlooked
are passports issued by consulates here in the United States.
Essentially we are looking for documents with your name and a date on
them that shows you were in the United States at a specific time.
So I guess it will be denied and i have to wait until september to file another one and wait another 8 months for it to be done.

That W2 from Peson doesnt show that he claims me but it might work as a prove that an immediate family member was in the country as well.
So now a total of 3 solid proves?

It's true ... we both are getting old ... and could not organize well. haha
Don't worry too much ... concentrate on your work. You plan and let us know. If we could make it we will see you then. Wipi has already booked her flight, starting from NYC on 1st Oct. so her trip will be extended until end of October. It's your idea that she should visit her family in Germany but she is not sure whether she could make it or not. The point is if she would go home (Bangkok) after the trip she will have too much luggage for travelling. Sofar I know she will station at Copenhagen (a friend has a place there) and travel around to London, Greece, Paris and Spain. She has not booked her return flight yet. I told her if she is visiting Germany she will know how to come back to Copenhagen by your help. Is this right?
I answer your questions below in red.
Hi Chu,
maybe the latest developments in Palestine will make us change
our plans again but now it looks like my colleague Laila will come to
Frankfurt in September, i.e. I need to go to Ramallah in October. I should stay
two weeks and cannot go before October 8 (the week before there are
Eid-celebrations in Ramallah and noody is working). I can shorten it a little
and come back on 19 or 20 but that would in any case mean I cannot make holiday
plans before. Sorry, but too many people involved and it is not easy to make
plans.
What do we do now? and as usual I am not
sure I understand what you want to tell me in your mail below - it is
getting worse with age (in my case I mean).
Question 1: Wipi is visiting Europe (passes Frankfurt/Erlensee
one time?) from October 1
to 21 and then she goes on to Bangkok? partly answer up there. I will cc: Wipi also this mail.
Question 2: You & Wiworn are thinking of going to Spain
also before Oct 21? or Italy/Germany? If we really go, Italy would be more interesting since our girl has already visited Spain by then. I don't think we would join Wipi & friends trip in Spain. You take your time for your work in Ramallah. We will plan accordingly.
Never give up hope,😊
love,
Anita

question
about email address ... sorry I don't remember ... just saw the
funny face as in skype so I took it ... haha.
She has already booked her flight (one-way to Copenhagen) on October 1,
2014. So she will end her trip in Spain around October 21.  Let's see if we
would join her or she can find her way back to Bangkok.
We still consider whether we are going.
Thanks anyway for the info.

Hey
you, the e-mail address with t-online was killed ages ago, so please delete it
in your address book as well, THANKS. I have only the one with
medico.
My
dear,
I
answer quickly below in red. By the way Roswitha’s holiday is really fixed now
for the period of Oct 25 till Nov 8, i.e. during this time we could make plans
together with her.
Hope
to hear from you soon again,
Love,

one short question
My
dear Anita,
How
is life in Ireland? We hope you enjoy your stay a lot. Get
some rest and back to work with full energy ...
Well, I did not make it to Ireland because I waited too long and the flight got
too expensive for the short trip, so I ended up on the train to
Bavaria/Tegernsee. But it was nice and relaxing indeed!
Wipi
is planning her holidays. It could be around 24th Sept - 14th
Oct.
She
is searching for cheap flights.
So
she starts asking whether we have interest to join her
somewhere.
I
remember you told me your Spain trip with Roswitha is around Oct 20 -
31.
We
would like to know:
1.
Is it possible to stay with you on the week of Oct. 14? If
we really join her. Oct
14 is a Tuesday, so you mean the week 13 -18 ? For me it is ok if we decide soon
soon (need to block it here).
2.
Is it nice to organize a trip to Italy?
Italy,
Rome or whatever is wonderful and always good visiting even in
autumn.
Just
inquire this information from you. We are not yet sure we are going to make this
trip.
no
hurry!
lots
of love,
Chu

We come to talk about tentative holidays again.
Wipi is planning to start her holidays around 24th Sept - 14th Oct. as follows:
NYC-Copenhagen Sept 24 - 26Copenhagen-London Sept. 27- Oct 3London-Greece Oct Oct 4 - 7Greece-Paris Oct 7 - 10Paris-Barcelona/Madrid Oct 10 - 13back to Copenhagen ... then either BKK or back to NYC
She is searching for cheap flights.
So she starts asking whether we have interest to join her somewhere.
I remember you told me your Spain trip is around Oct 20 - 31.
The question is:
1. Is it possible to stay with you the week of Oct. 14?
2. Or is it nice to organize something like Italy since she already visited Spain by then?
I think we will have around 2 weeks time.

coding class: In this course, we will take JavaScript to the next level. Our focus
will be organizing larger projects using JavaScript patterns and
object-oriented programming. We'll look deeper at popular JavaScript
libraries like jQuery and Raphael, and explore how to extend these
libraries by writing plug-ins and extensions. We'll build medium-size
web apps that make use of HTML5 and CSS3. Finally, we will discuss
targeting applications for different platforms, including the iPhone and
the iPad. Through repetition and in-class exercises, students will
investigate different programming techniques to find solutions to
real-world problems.  PREREQUISITE: SMC-2527, Getting Started with
JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 and jQuery, or equivalent.
typeface design class: Whether you want to create a font for personal use, or you have an idea
for a typeface that will take the design world by storm, this course
will immerse you in the process of designing an original typeface and
creating a font. The entire process, from research and conceptualizing
to drawing and digitizing will be covered. Commercial aspects of the
type design business will also be presented.   Note: Access to either
FontLab Studio 5 or Adobe Illustrator is required.
such a tough choice......

We should ask how many nights they want to stay 10 or 9. If 10 the price is 750. But if 9 nights = 675.-
One more is we are non smoking place. They should consider this also.
He comes alone?

he is so cute ... could be our standing guest.
This is what they wrote about us:
The apartment was absolutely amazing. A very clean and upscale building, the unit was equally impressive - very nice views, a large shower, and comfortable bed to rest on after a long day exploring Bangkok. Wifi worked great, and she even left us some nice treats in the kitchen! Very thankful to have had a chance to access the pool on the top floor as it really is something that blows you away - breathtaking to say the least. Not the most walkable neighbourhood, but easy access to the closest metro (5 mins) and a short to ride to other fantastic areas in the city. Affordable taxis didn't have trouble bringing us back when it got later. Wipawe and her mother were there for all our questions, and made sure it was a smooth and carefree stay. She was also nice enough to provide a small phone for the duration of the stay. Overall, wish the stay could have been even longer - highly recommended!
Nice ner.

If i miss anything let me know.

Below is the address+direction to my apartment in Thai. You can show this to Taxi Driver and they should be able to take you there.

I will explain briefly in English for you: The address is 14/2 Soi Chareon Nakorn  Thonburi Road Bangkok
The apartment complex is called Urbano Absolute. I provided directions to go to the place via BTS to your mom already. If you need me to forward that to you, let me know. Essentially, it's by Krung Thonburi Station. Take exit 3 and walk about 340 m. to the apartment complex.
My room is on 20th floor. Room number: 345/233 Per arrival, you will need to provide your passport to get the room key and key card at the front desk and please return at the front desk before you leave.
A mobile phone with usable sim card will be provided for you in the room. You can use data (although it's not fancy phone ie. iphone) but can't make international call.
If you need help talking to Taxi or getting around or anything you can all this number and ask for Jelly: 083-815-7616 (my mom)
Below are map and other photos to help you get to the apartment. Some text are in Thai so you can show to Taxi driver.
Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or concerns! Have fun in Bangkok!!
Hi Wipawe,
I hope you don't mind me contacting you directly - my name is Ivan and my mom gave me your email to organize my arrival to your apartment! Although we were hoping to have my mom meet me in Bangkok, it looks like it will be just me and a friend. My airbnb profile can be seen at  if you'd like to have a look! My flight is with AirAsia and gets into DMK at 1pm (#FD3238) on Friday the 18th. I'd love to take a taxi from the airport - would you be able to provide the address (and possibly directions) in both English and Thai for the driver?
Thank you for all your help!

an envelop with key card and room key was given to the front office.
Let him tell our room no. 345/233 so they will give him the envelop when he identifies himself by showing his passport.

Check The OilBy David C. McCaslandSubscribe on iTunesPlay MP3 (Mobile)Select a LanguageRead: Psalm 5My voice You shall hear in the morning, OLord; in the morning I will direct it to You, and I will look up. —Psalm 5:3Bible in a Year:
Ruth 1-4; Luke 8:1-25When I helped our daughters learn to drive, I included a little instruction on basic auto maintenance. We visited a local service station where they learned to check the oil every time they put fuel in the car. Today, years later, they often remind me of my six-word slogan, “Oil is cheap; engines are expensive.” Adding a quart of oil is nothing compared to replacing an engine.Maintenance is also important in our spiritual lives. Taking time each day to read the Bible, pray, and listen to God is a key element in avoiding a breakdown. In Psalm 5, David wrote, “My voice You shall hear in the morning, O Lord; in the morning I will direct it to You” (v.3). In the following verses he poured out his heart in praise, thanksgiving, and requests to God.Many people find it essential to begin every day with the Lord. Before checking email, catching the news, or eating breakfast, they find some quiet moments alone to read a portion of God’s Word, praise Him for His greatness, thank Him for His love, and seek His guidance. Others spend time reading and praying at different times of the day.It’s not magic—it’s maintenance, as we ask the Lord each day to fill our hearts with His presence on the road of life.Give me a strong desire, O Lord, to look into Your
Word each day. Help me hide it in my heart so that
I might not stray from Your truth. Feed me and
teach me about Yourself and Your will for me.The roots of stability come from being grounded in God’s Word and prayer.InsightIn this morning prayer (vv.1-3), David called out to God to help him live a holy and worshipful life (vv.7-8). He extolled God’s justice, holiness, and unfailing love (vv.4-7), and he affirmed his unwavering trust in God’s presence and protection (vv.4-8,11-12) even as he faced slander, danger, and evil.

Now i am in my 50s,it became a routine to me too.Log in to Reply	blessiveThis is so true getting up first thing in the morning and given GOD thanks and praised he talks to me often in my bathroom AND I CHERISH IT!!!!!!Log in to ReplyLeave a ReplyYou must be logged in to post a comment.Categories: Archives Attitudes Basics Of Faith Christian Life Relating To GodTags: God's guidance God's love God's presence prayer quiet time reading

1. what is P Pi website?
2. I would like to know how they (the two guests) spend their one day here. When arrive? what activities they have interest?
I just asked Urbano ... we can leave the keycard at the front with the guest's name ... on the day leaving they can give it back there. Office hour (front hours) is: 8.00-20.00 h. everyday.
3. I asked about using swimming pool she said it's opened from 6.00-21.00 h. reserved for owners. I think if one has a key card, it's owner anyway... do you remember how it worked last time when you were up there ... need to sign up anything?
4. about internet ... starts with 599, 699 and 799 (which is included 12 MB, true Vision cable TV and one tel cim card of 299 free call) .. at least a year with guarantee amount 1,000.- if not they ִ 1,000)

I think so ... strange ... normally if it's official online form, they should not be able to sell any service.
Thanks again, Tu.
CC: 
Are you preparing tax return and the software you use is asking you to pay for "audit defense"?  They just  IRS may audit your tax return so you buy whatever they sell. Don't worry. You don't need it. Don't buy.  The chance you get audited is very slim because it's a simple tax return and not big money.

Hi,
So far I did the home page, about page and products page.
The top part of the about page is empty right now because I want to incorporate info graphics explaining how info-d or homc works. That, i will need you to write a simple diagram or explain to me in detail so I can illustrate out nicely.
The images I used on products page are not final. Ideally, I would want to use other images that would convey the message better but for mock up purpose, I just used whatever picture I have.

Hi,
So far I did the home page, about page and products page.
The top part of the about page is empty right now because I want to incorporate info graphics explaining how info-d or homc works. That, i will need you to write a simple diagram or explain to me in detail so I can illustrate out nicely.
The images I used on products page are not final. Ideally, I would want to use other images that would convey the message better but for mock up purpose, I just used whatever picture I have.

you forgot one amount of 50,000 baht which I transferred to your thai account. Wip, please help look during those period how much you transferred Peson so I could really conclude.
Hi
Here is detail I got from bank account:
04/19 you transferred $4,750 to me
04/29 you transferred $ 23,000 to me
05/20 you transferred $30,000 to me
09/30 you transferred $10,000 to me
12/31 you transferred $8,000 to me
Total: $75,750
PS: money from mutual fund $9,000 didn't get out in full because I made some loss in 2008-2009 and sold partially to cut losses at that time. However, if added, $75,750+$9,000= $84,750
And with scholarship added: $84,750+$15,000 = $99,750 which I am still missing around $7,000. I actually missed more than that because I only got $6,900 from mutual fund.
Don't worry you didn't cheat me. I just want to clarify.
Peson
P,
Could you please send me the statement of your citi account from March-December 2013?
Some figure during the first payments via Nong was not clear to me. (April 2013 the whole month)
By the way, the total figure from Babson is 106,598 - 15,000 (scholarship) = 91,598.
I think I have only transferred you 77,750.- US$ after I reducted 161,000 baht (for tithe) and 50,000.- baht to your account.
So no doubt, you don't have enough. This 77,750 needs to add 9000 (your dad said he gave you long time ago for buying stock).
I just don't want to be blamed I was cheating you all. Probably my figure was wrong. Let's check, it won't take much time.
take care, my dear!
tomorrow and the day after tomorrow I will not be in.
take your time & take care.

1. I am rather sure that I gave you the full amount from dad. 2.6 mill (right?) In my bank book I got only 2.5 mill. from dad. O.k. I reducted 160,000 for offering (sib lod) so you got = 2,440,000.-
2. Wip doesn't help me look how much I gave you via her before the first transfer directly to your account since I started from 4750.- (strange amount)
3. Perhaps I should give you more another 5000 US$ to settle my side if Wip could not figure out how much she transferred you.
If I calculated it wrong I won't give you the last amount of 8,000 only. So I am sure I have done it right.
4. Dad starts talking about money you sold your old car at Berkeley time. hu  ... where the money gone?
So he is convinced he gave you around 3 mill. for sure or enough for your study  and I am the one who create all the problems since I did not note down.
5. I don't want you to have problem with loan ... so please let us know before you take any loan action. This is how family good for.
you understand?

please help look Peson whether you got the amount Wip mentioned. April 19 must be 2,200.- before I come to conclusion.
I am filing your tax return now, Peson. I think you got money back 4,500 baht. Today I will fill out again without 440 which you paid for selling stock of ccet. It should be alright without it. I don't want them (sanpakorn) to ask for proof later. I hope it's o.k. with you.
Dad is convinced to attend your graduation. What's possible there i.e. accommodation etc.?
It's 2 days already two banks (standard charter and citibank here) offer me loan without interest or just 1%. First I ignore but now remember you have to pay 6% for your loan. Should I consider? haha
CC: 
Apr 12 - I got transferred $5000Apr 19 - $22,00 went out of my accountand theres a check with a memo said "peson's" in May in the amount of $1175
Thats all from my side that I can see....
All I remember was mom transferred money to me asking me send it to peson but then I can only send a small amount at a time or something like that and then mom figured out how to do it from her side so she did and all I did was transfer money to peson's friend for his rent. That's all.

one more question : P, 26 June 2013 I didn't transferred you 15,000.- $? Please help check.
Thanks!
tomorrow and the day after tomorrow I will not be in.
take your time & take care.
you forgot one amount of 50,000 baht which I transferred to your thai account. Wip, please help look during those period how much you transferred Peson so I could really conclude.
Hi
Here is detail I got from bank account:
04/19 you transferred $4,750 to me
04/29 you transferred $ 23,000 to me
05/20 you transferred $30,000 to me
09/30 you transferred $10,000 to me
12/31 you transferred $8,000 to me
Total: $75,750
PS: money from mutual fund $9,000 didn't get out in full because I made some loss in 2008-2009 and sold partially to cut losses at that time. However, if added, $75,750+$9,000= $84,750
And with scholarship added: $84,750+$15,000 = $99,750 which I am still missing around $7,000. I actually missed more than that because I only got $6,900 from mutual fund.
Don't worry you didn't cheat me. I just want to clarify.
Peson
P,
Could you please send me the statement of your citi account from March-December 2013?
Some figure during the first payments via Nong was not clear to me. (April 2013 the whole month)
By the way, the total figure from Babson is 106,598 - 15,000 (scholarship) = 91,598.
I think I have only transferred you 77,750.- US$ after I reducted 161,000 baht (for tithe) and 50,000.- baht to your account.
So no doubt, you don't have enough. This 77,750 needs to add 9000 (your dad said he gave you long time ago for buying stock).
I just don't want to be blamed I was cheating you all. Probably my figure was wrong. Let's check, it won't take much time.
take care, my dear!

will you find cheap accommodation somewhere nearby? I don't know why he said so ... like not possible ... could not believe.
you guys should still come tho. you paid over 3M baht and ok with not seeing anything (both in berkeley and here?). That's too much faith. Up to you. It would be weird if I go by myself.
Pi chai said it's impossible to find any accommodation right now in a reasonable price. All are fully booked. Perhaps we should send you as representative. ... haha
bring p'wan to the graduation too. and loong and paa if possible. Thanks.
peson, answer duay!
CC: 
1. please help look Peson whether you got the amount Wip mentioned. April 19 must be 2,200.- before I come to conclusion.
2. I am filing your tax return now, Peson. I think you got money back 4,500 baht. Today I will fill out again without 440 which you paid for selling stock of ccet. It should be alright without it. I don't want them (sanpakorn) to ask for proof later. I hope it's o.k. with you. Ja submit laew na. You got back every penny you paid at vitamin = 4,593.34 baht. I don't add the ccet stock since you paid 440 but you will get back 100 something.
3. Dad is convinced to attend your graduation. What's possible there i.e. accommodation etc.?
4. It's 2 days already two banks (standard charter and citibank here) offer me loan without interest or just 1%. First I ignore but now remember you have to pay 6% for your loan. Should I consider? haha
CC: 
Apr 12 - I got transferred $5000
Apr 19 - $22,00 went out of my accountand theres a check with a memo said "peson's" in May in the amount of $1175
Thats all from my side that I can see....
All I remember was mom transferred money to me asking me send it to peson but then I can only send a small amount at a time or something like that and then mom figured out how to do it from her side so she did and all I did was transfer money to peson's friend for his rent. That's all.
1. I am rather sure that I gave you the full amount from dad. 2.6 mill (right?) In my bank book I got only 2.5 mill. from dad. O.k. I reducted 160,000 for offering (sib lod) so you got = 2,440,000.-
2. Wip doesn't help me look how much I gave you via her before the first transfer directly to your account since I started from 4750.- (strange amount)
3. Perhaps I should give you more another 5000 US$ to settle my side if Wip could not figure out how much she transferred you.
If I calculated it wrong I won't give you the last amount of 8,000 only. So I am sure I have done it right.
4. Dad starts talking about money you sold your old car at Berkeley time. hu  ... where the money gone?
So he is convinced he gave you around 3 mill. for sure or enough for your study  and I am the one who create all the problems since I did not note down.
5. I don't want you to have problem with loan ... so please let us know before you take any loan action. This is how family good for.

in the middle of talking with P'Wan whether they will join.
I asked them yesterday. She started calling me this morning at skype at 8:20 while I was not showing up.
let's see. I found the thing about urbano while I tried to search for accommodation in Boston ... quite a lot at airbnb.
Perhaps he doesn't want to see us. Must make a surprise if we really go!
come stay in new york and just go to boston for the day? how long do u plan to stay anyways....?
will you find cheap accommodation somewhere nearby? I don't know why he said so ... like not possible ... could not believe.

I saw one in Allston. Is it Peson's place?
Anyway, ҡ ͧԹ
繾ҹѺاѺ plan ѧǷ蹻» اҡµѧ 仴
I found a lot of places to stay in boston from air bnb. Its in the area close to Tufts Uni or around Harvard/MIT which means its far away from peson's place but I can drive. I drove in boston before its ok to drive. The rooms range from 60-150$ i think.....
Let me know how it goes with p'wan.

Yesterday Pa called me from Chiang Mai with no special topics. She will move back to Bangkok soon soon, since Na Kaek and Verdun are on their way back from Canada.
One topic she mentioned is about her niece (daughter of Pa Dtiem's brother) is now living in New York, kind of work and study, at a restaurant but will take a course there and expect to come back in 5-6 months. She already been there a while ... no problem with living. (rich being working that kind of work)
Pa prayed that God will send an angel to lead her to Christ. Pi Wan and Lung do not agree to bother you, thinking that you are so different.
Just in case you would like to be an angel instead of a monster (right now ... saying and acting too much with the bad ex-housemate) ... haha!
nothing ...just share.

1. They can use taxi meter: around 200-300 baht, depending on the traffic (attached map below pasathai for taxi)2. Or taking BTS Mor chit (BTS Chatuchak) take special bus A1 at DMK

ให้เค้าลง S7 Krung Thon Buri Station บางทีชอบสะกดไม่เหมือนกัน อันนี้ถูกต้องดูจาก BTS Map
ถ้า รวบรวม เสร็จ ขอดูด้วย เผื่อไว้บอกคนอื่นๆ นะ อุตส่าห์ research มา เสียเวลากว่าไปรับอีก
ไว้จะซื้อผลไม้หน้าโบสถ์ ใส่กล่องไปไว้ในตู้เย็น ถ้ามีโอกาสไปก่อนหนึ่งวัน ไม่งั้นอาจเน่าได้ ร้อนระเบิด กรุงเทพฯ ตอนนี้
ok this is great. dont need other pics la.

Hi Wipawe! I'm thrilled to have been able to book your accommodations. If you have a chance, can you please send along instructions on how to best reach the apartment from the airport (DMK)? I can't seem to see the detailed address on the booking itinerary. Thanks again!

what sim card? you mean the phone. yes ... already there. phone no. is 091-747-1359 ... depending what kind of phone he uses.
now we put the sim in a plain phone (old style) ... dad has one spare samsung ... but afraid it's too costly. If he wants to buy a sim at the airport .. it will be fine too.
we already got him the sim card right???? confirm so i can tell her.

Hi! Thank you so much for the help! It's probably easiest to send the documents directly to my son at . His flight arrives into DMK airport at 1pm. The phone is very convenient thank you - from what I understand, he will try his best to get a Thai sim card as well. Thanks again!

It's 299 pro per month come with internet package wifi for our condo room. I checked already it could not used for international call. So just for used between me and him or anybody in Thailand, not more than 300 min. Only the phone is not easy to use for internet like iPhone or Samsung. Ja shoot phone hai do.
Sent from my iPhone
ไม่เติมเงิน เป็นแบบได้ 3 package เพราะซื้อ wifi กับ true ที่ติดที่คอนโด มีให้ cable tv อีกอย่าง โทรศัพท์ก็เป็นแบบเล่นเนทไม่จำกัด โทรออกได้ไม่เกิน 299 บาท โทรต่างประเทศไม่ได้
พรุ่งนี้จะ facetime จากคอนโดไปหา
รูปที่ส่ง line ไป เป็นโทรศัพท์ที่จะให้เค้าใช้ เล่นเนทได้ แต่ต้องกดแบบโทรศัพท์โบราณน่ะ ไม่ใช่ โทรศัพท์แบบ samsung หรือ iphone
ปล. เบิกเงินจาก atm citibank หรือ เห็น 40 เหรียญ แล้วต้องโอนค่าเช่าบ้านไปหรือเปล่า

Hi Wipi,
Could you please spare some time in your hiding of the heavy snow in NYC to send Anita some photos to show how you like the place at Urbano?
Kind of Propaganda for Anita to come 😊
Thanks,
mom
แม่คุณ รูปโป๊ๆ ซะเยอะเชียว ... อิอิ ... ตื่นแล้วหรือ

Of course!
Anita, you have to come. Bring Roswitha with you as well! Urbano is such a nice place to stay. Serenity in the midst of busy Bangkok. You know when you're in the middle and its too overwhelming, you go up high! I love the room and the rooftop so much I almost want to give up New York and move back home! Haha Attaches are some of the pictures I took.
How are you doing by the way? I'm kind of sad I didn't get to go to Frankfurt to see the booth I designed/see you and the family. It's a wholesale event for buyers and I have no business/selling skills so I'm stuck here in New York. Poor me! Haha. It's been too long since I last saw you. I've gain and lost a total of 10 kgs in the past few years so for a lot of people I've changed a lot. May be I'll look the same to you since last I saw you I was about this size as well haha!
My bestfriend from college is now living in Hamburg so I have been planning a Euro trip with her. I'm not sure when it will happen (hopefully by September this year) but I'll make sure to visit my Auntie Anita! (I'm very interested to go to Spain and Greece, do you have suggestions!?) If not you are more than welcome to come visit me (and may be Peson as well since we are close by) in New York, or we can find our ways to serenity back in Urbano in Bangkok!
Hugs and Kisses! Ps. I went on conference calls with a German designer to coordinate the booth design and the way she talks reminds me of you a lot! I miss you!

Respond to Vanessa by replying directly to this email.
Hi again! Thanks so much for the fast response. I live and work in Toronto as an Analyst at a financial institution. My son, Ivan, is actually the one taking the photo in my profile picture :) He moved away from home to Paris about a year ago - first to wrap up his business degree and now for work. He's currently at a tech startup in the music streaming market. Although he loves it, he booked himself a getaway in April to South East Asia. He has one night in Bangkok before he flies to Hong Kong, and that's where I plan to meet him! I thought it would be a nice treat to book him a nice place with a pool, and your apartment more than fits the bill! Not sure if you're able to look it up, but I believe his own profile page is number 375140? I know you might not believe me because I'm his mom, but he's a very kind and respectful young man. Hope that gives you a bit of an idea :)

Hi Mark,
Thank you for your reply.   No problem, we'll wait for a few days. Every time we talk about TCS, we thank God for sending Rev. Carl Blanford to Sapan Luang Church. The efforts and sacrifices that he and family gave us is something that we will never forget.The best thing is there is a real Blanford standing there to give the award.
Blessings, Charn
Sent from Samsung Mobile
Hi Charn,
Thank you for thinking of us again, my friend. It is indeed a privilege to carry on the Blanford award at TCS. Give us a couple more days to collaborate on it, if you could.-Mark
Hi Mark,
Hope this email finds you well.   It's that time of the year again that students will graduate from TCS again.   Will you be kind enough to write another note of congratulations to them.  Or should we use the one from last year.
Kindly advise.
Blessings, Charn

around March or April last year, do you remember (or find out) how much money you transferred to P's account (at that time when I thought I could not do it by myself.)
I was accused I didn't transfer him the amount your dad gave via me. Now he is loaning quite a bit.
Let me know if you have some records.
P,
you should leave your phone no. with the college office. Take action!
Thank God you are safe.

The Contract terms include rules about limits on liability for personal injury or death and for loss, damage, or delay of goods and baggage, check-in times, overbooking, security issues, reservations, denial of carriage, refunds, claims limits and restrictions, including time limitations for filing a claim or lawsuit, and schedule changes and irregularities.  The Contract of Carriage contains further detail of these terms.
Additional Terms - Depending on the rules applicable to the fare paid, one or more restrictions including, but not limited to one or more of the following, may apply to your travel: (1) the ticket may not be refundable but may be exchangeable for a fee with another restricted fare ticket meeting all the rules/restrictions of the original ticket (including the payment of any difference in fares); (2) a fee may apply for changing/canceling reservations; or (3) travel may be restricted to specific flights and/or times and minimum and/or maximum stay may be required.

For travel within the U.S., United excludes liability for fragile, valuable or perishable items carried in all baggage including jewelry, computers, cash, camera equipment and similar valuables.

NoticeOverbooking of Flights - Airline flights may be overbooked, and there is a slight chance that a seat will not be available on a flight for which a person has a confirmed reservation. If the flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their reservation in exchange for compensation of the airline's choosing. If there are not enough volunteers, the airline will deny boarding to other persons in accordance with its particular boarding priority. With few exceptions, including failure to comply with the carrier's check-in deadline which are available upon request from the air carrier, persons denied boarding involuntarily are entitled to compensation. The complete rules for the payment of compensation and each airline's boarding priorities are available at all airport ticket counters and boarding locations.

Hi Chu,
meanwhile I checked on all ends but it seems that I cannot
make it, on the one hand the flights are so expensive during christams / New
Year season - more than double the price - and I do not really get holiday -
high season at medico as well...
So this time without me even so I would have loved to see and
meet you all again.
Have to rush to the bus now,
hugs & kisses,
Anita

It's always good to have a dear "Tante" = Auntie out there. She will be

P.S. Anita, are you coming to join us during Christmas in NYC? We will have

Who would have known that I would have to deal with the germans

NW, Wip,
Just think of your friend, Kate, whether she is going to England during Christmas so we can rent her apt. No idea where it is.
What do you think, Wip?
Just in case.
Thanks, Wan

is this ok? Upper east side..good area..not too far not too close...only one bedroom but sofa bed outside..let me know so i can book asap
Respond to Chris by replying directly to this email.
Hi,They are at the moment, though there have been a couple of queries. There is a double sofa bed in the living room so plenty of room for 2 there, as well as the bedroom.The only challenge is that there are guests who leave on the 23rd and I won't be back in between. I can give you fresh sheets and clean towels, but you will have to put them on.Hope that's okay.Chris

as per our discussion today it seems we come to the conclusion that you will not make it according to your calculation. Not sure we start and end up it right.
Just review it again:
1. You plan to come home after 2 years + your friend's wedding. (planned already for a while)
2. If we pay you the round trip ticket will you make it (make end meets) after return since you will get half paid salary?
3. Will you plan for other holidays soon which you should afford it?
4. Reviewing may help. Sometimes something is not going as it is, even sometimes without reasons ... just let us know whether we had break your plan. Or even if you still think you really want to come home for 2 weeks and it makes sense for you.
pro + con first and pray.

It's always good to have a dear "Tante" = Auntie out there. She will be your best supporter.

P.S. Anita, are you coming to join us during Christmas in NYC? We will have a family reunion for 5 nights there and another 5 nights in Boston. You are our family member, remember?
Who would have known that I would have to deal with the germans later in my life. Now I have no idea what this document is about. haha.
I'm designing a tradeshow booth which will be held in Frankfurt in February. Dealing with a German account executive, spoke with her on the phone, she sounded just like Anita. May be Anita can drop by the show and see my design hahahaha

Prima! Super quick!
It seems perfect ... Just realize that I have to wait in Inchoen for nearly a day. Perhaps we should try visit some churches. haha!
The price is even better ... thanks!
Please keep BR like that since other options are not possible. (the one to JFK first.)
I will give my passport details soon.
Thanks again.
Dear
Lee,
Just
now, I sent u flight itinerary on OZ to L.A and return from JFK all booking in
K/class, just now I found out that S/class (lower than K) is opened again,
therefore I rebooked every thing the same except in S/class, fare is 39,595 per
person (tax 12,885 is included) and is subjected to change.  Conditions
are: refund fee is approximately 3,000 for unused ticket, rebooking at same
booking class S is permitted. Ticket dead line is 4 Nov.
TG
ROP is noted.
Seat
assignment is available only after ticket issuance.
For
other options, should I cancel or should I hold, the previous options are to
JFK first and return from L.A.
Still
pending for your passport no. / and expire date.

when you consider whatsoever regarding your travel this time, it all depends on you.
1. your citizenship (it takes 5 mo. process)2. your stay (NYC, CAL)3. your health4. your job
consider it well. We are not the big factor. We can go wherever we like. We plan to see you since we think you cannot take a long holidays. But if you have other plan ... it's o.k. with us.

No serious if you don't like it at all we can cancel this Christmas trip.

Ephesians 6:5-8 MSG
"Servants, respectfully obey your earthly masters but always with an eye to obeying the real master, Christ. Don’t just do what you have to do to get by, but work heartily, as Christ’s servants doing what God wants you to do. And work with a smile on your face, always keeping in mind that no matter who happens to be giving the orders, you’re really serving God. Good work will get you good pay from the Master, regardless of whether you are slave or free."

why they said quikbook need membership? I will check.
They wanted to stay in the high end hotel, of course will be expensive. They are a lot of boutique hotels, nice and clean and probably less or a little more that $200.00 / night. Quikbook doesn't need to be membership.

since they are  ... it could be they track you (... not remember how it worked last time with greencard)
they might follow you ... gu luck said normally the government wont do this.
I think we were trapped since last time from greencard ... that's why we had to pay the online application fee. (this is not stated in the uscis.gov) ¡ѹٹ
we may apply directly to uscis.gov

let me ask you this:
1. what do you mean by saying it's a job? Do they have other benefit except paying daily 50$?2. do you also apply to other companies? all just 2 as you mentioned before.
want to talk skype?
Hi,
Attached is new letterhead design per your request.
I made the "i" with circle and provide 3 options.
I got the color down but to  make it easier, I'll let you know the exact color after you tell me which one you want. Just let me know.
Also,
I got another intern offer after applying for 2 days. Went for an interview and got the job.
But I'm hesitating in taking it - not sure if it's worth it since they only gonna pay stipend ($50 a day) and most of their clients are non-profit (which I'm not really into) but its a job..and may be its better than doing nothing? or is it better to hold off a bit and may be set forth to only look for freelance job or full time job? what do you think? I might have to give answer to him soon.

I got the color down but to  make it easier, I'll let you know the exact color after you tell me which one you want. Just let me know.
Also,
I got another intern offer after applying for 2 days. Went for an interview and got the job.
But I'm hesitating in taking it - not sure if it's worth it since they only gonna pay stipend ($50 a day) and most of their clients are non-profit (which I'm not really into) but its a job..and may be its better than doing nothing? or is it better to hold off a bit and may be set forth to only look for freelance job or full time job? what do you think? I might have to give answer to him soon.
This is the company:

Lamentations 3:25-28 NIV
"The Lord is good to those whose hope is in him, to the one who seeks him; it is good to wait quietly for the salvation of the Lord. It is good for a man to bear the yoke while he is young. Let him sit alone in silence, for the Lord has laid it on him."

our mileage will expire in 2 days. Do you have any suggestion when should we fly? Is it Nov or Dec this year or when?
Please give hint as soon as possible.
expire soon.
just read your mail. We have booked flight this morning for April 29 - May 22, 2014. It's enough reason to attend babson commencement.
take care you all,
love,
mom
if you wanna come in nov come during thanksgiving holiday. i think usually its nov 25 or sth like that...you can check it online...or if you wanna come december you should coming during christmas or new year...but i think december would be too cold to enjoy.
if you wanna come in may..its gonna be pretty hot and humid..a lot of rain...and there's no holiday...so if i already got a job i probably can't hang out that much. but if its for peson graduation..i think babson's grad is around mid may...check with him..
so up to you. my suggestion is to come during thanksgiving becuz its the longest holiday and its the one time other than christmas that people usually spend it with family.
it was about 3-8 degree celcius when I came here last thanksgiving. so it's cold. but bearable.
our mileage will expire in 2 days. Do you have any suggestion when should we fly? Is it Nov or Dec this year or when?
Please give hint as soon as possible.
expire soon.

I found this in the internet ... is this kind o.k.?
By the way, which part of you in NYC?
should I continue searching for you ... r u kind of digital graphic design or anything? tell me ... I hope you find a job soon. I saw frog in NYC also they just announced an intern for June3rd.
Sorry last nite it was too late to discuss about money so I gave the phone to your dad (thought he always loves to talk to his daughter) but it was a mistake ... he has no idea at all.
Shall I transfer you more? ... let me know the amount! I will do.
Don't be too desperate! God will not leave you or forsake you.
I'm in manhattan.Mid town east to be exact but anywhere in manhattan i can go work too. Thanks,

don't lose heart. With frog you may try again. It can be when it's not the time for their opening. Pi P got internship from Frog in Shanghai this April 2013. He was not in school. He got it for June 2013 but he has to come to Babson. Try. .. don't need to think of others much. We just send out as many as possible. There must be one for you.
If we give you more 500 is it o.k.? We agreed to give you more anyway.
I'm graphic design - branding/web base/anything along that line is ok.It's hard to find a job for me..it's ok ill find it myself..dont waste your time. I can't do interns because i need to be in school to do so. Also, I applied frog before. I didn't get it. So it's ok.
I'm thinking about going back to bangkok. I dont know how desperate I need to get the citizenship. Because there's really no point to stay here. I can't get a job and I dont want to go back to school for master now. New York isn't gonna teach me anything if I don't have money. I spend all my time at work where I earn $40 a day. I can't even do waitress because I don't have time. And if I don't have money, I can't really do anything here. Just staying here in the room itself costs around $60/day. So with my $16 a day, I can barely go out/do anything. And if I'm jst gonna stay here in my room then I don't see why I can't do that back home.
should I continue searching for you ... r u kind of digital graphic design or anything? tell me ... I hope you find a job soon. I saw frog in NYC also they just announced an intern for June3rd.
Sorry last nite it was too late to discuss about money so I gave the phone to your dad (thought he always loves to talk to his daughter) but it was a mistake ... he has no idea at all.
Shall I transfer you more? ... let me know the amount! I will do.
Don't be too desperate! God will not leave you or forsake you.
I'm in manhattan.Mid town east to be exact but anywhere in manhattan i can go work too.

don't lose heart. With frog you may try again. It can be when it's not the time for their opening. Pi P got internship from Frog in Shanghai this April 2013. He was not in school. He got it for June 2013 but he has to come to Babson. Try. .. don't need to think of others much. We just send out as many as possible. There must be one for you.
If we give you more 500 is it o.k.? We agreed to give you more anyway.
I'm graphic design - branding/web base/anything along that line is ok.It's hard to find a job for me..it's ok ill find it myself..dont waste your time. I can't do interns because i need to be in school to do so. Also, I applied frog before. I didn't get it. So it's ok.
I'm thinking about going back to bangkok. I dont know how desperate I need to get the citizenship. Because there's really no point to stay here. I can't get a job and I dont want to go back to school for master now. New York isn't gonna teach me anything if I don't have money. I spend all my time at work where I earn $40 a day. I can't even do waitress because I don't have time. And if I don't have money, I can't really do anything here. Just staying here in the room itself costs around $60/day. So with my $16 a day, I can barely go out/do anything. And if I'm jst gonna stay here in my room then I don't see why I can't do that back home.

Jeremiah 17:5-8 NIV
"This is what the Lord says: “Cursed is the one who trusts in man, who draws strength from mere flesh and whose heart turns away from the Lord. That person will be like a bush in the wastelands; they will not see prosperity when it comes. They will dwell in the parched places of the desert, in a salt land where no one lives. “But blessed is the one who trusts in the Lord, whose confidence is in him. They will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by the stream. It does not fear when heat comes; its leaves are always green. It has no worries in a year of drought and never fails to bear fruit.”"

thanks a lot. She works somewhere in town ... not sure where it is. only 3 days a week.
i think they plan a year ahead whenever they will have reunion. I will try my best to attend.
take care,
P.S. Is Charlene feeling o.k.? You said the younger one is doing better. Hope they both are blessed.
Please do so.  Please ask her to introduce herself whenever she can.  Where is her job? My daughters are doing ok in the new school.  The younger one is doing better.   I will not be able to go to Thailand this March.  How often is the reunion?  I wish I know well in advance next time .
Hi RV,
My daughter is in town since last Nov. She told me she went to Thai Orchid from time to time. I asked whether anybody there recognized her. She said no. Would you like her to introduce herself to khun Nong? She got an intern job without paid. Still looking for a new offer.
How are your kids? The two girls are already settled well at colleges?
Hope you all are doing fine.

P.S. Satrivid 18 will re-unite this year March 9. Are you coming?

so. i applied for a graphic design intern for this company november5th. they got back to me last week.
they are in sf. have offices in sf/nyc/london. their clients include: GE, United Airlines, UBS, Zurich, BMW
But most important of all, they are paying $850 a WEEK. (possibly $3400 a month?) the internship runs for 12 weeks starting January.
and I have an appointment to go interview this friday in sf (plane ticket about $200)
I dont know why this is happening to me right now (after i moved down for a week) But please get me some feedbacks.
You can look for more info in the emails below. would be great if you guys can get back to me tonight.
Thanks,
W
Normally, I would not share this information with candidates prior to interviewing, but given your circumstances, Im happy to make an exception. We are offering Design Interns $850/week for the duration of the internship. The internship runs for 12 weeks and would start in early January. Hope this helps, but please keep this information confidential. And please let me know if you are still interested in the position.

Hi Laura,
Sorry I missed your call.
Friday 11am should work for me. However, I have one final question: Can I know about the pay of this internship? I'm interested in moving and also interested in the company but I have to make budget justification. It would be very helpful to know the estimates of the pay.
Thank you so much,
Hi Wipawe,
I just tried your cell, but it said your voicemail has not been set up yet. I was able to set up interviews with our team on Friday morning starting at 11am in the morning. Please let me know if this works for you and Ill send you all the details.
Thanks,
Laura

Dear Laura,  Yes, I was in Sacramento but i had just moved down recently.
I would say that I originally preferred and am willing to work in the Bay area more than Los Angeles.
There is no problem for me to fly back to meet with you guys at my own cost. However, I would still want to know more about the pay so I can make my decision. And also, is there a big chance for me to get this intern position ie. are there a lot of candidates?
Sorry for so many questions, Thank you,
yes, I'm sorry I didn't answer your question earlier. This is a paid internship and it runs for 12 weeks. It would likely start in early January.
Unfortunately, we don't have the ability to pay for your travel up and back so I understand if this is not the right time for you. Let me know your thoughts. I thought you were living in the Bay Area so I'm sorry we didn't discuss this earlier.
Best,
Laura

Dear Recruiting,
I am interested in applying for graphic design intern position at Prophet, which I learned about through Coroflot website.
I am a recent graduate from UC Davis with Bachelor of Arts major in design with emphasis on exhibition and graphic design and minor in communications. I was a member of the graphics team for Miss Asia Sacramento Scholarship Foundation where I got to experience working with deadlines in professional setting. I provide creative, strong viewpoints in the teamwork setting. I also did freelance projects such as designing graphic identity and marketing materials. I have proficient skills using Adobe suite and other execution programs and languages including HTML5 and CSS3. With the research University like UC Davis as my background, my designs are thoughtful and different. I believe that my practical work experience and solid educational background has prepared me for making contribution to Prophet.
Sincerely,
Wipawe Sirikolkarn
if they contact you tomorrow for a concrete interview date then you should book your flight. Are there more job openings in NY?  so then you can plan for how long you are going to stay there. But I know this is difficult.
If they accept you normally they will ask you to work immediately, I guess. Any way, they found out now that you are not in town. Perhaps you may ask about the starting date of employment or they may tell you.

please dont forward to everyone in the world. not a big deal. jst saying. this is a paid job. may be i should go? if so, please send money.thank you.

Hi Sophia,
Since I'm not in New York right now, I can do phone/skype interview this week if you want. However my schedule is pretty open in the following week. I can fly over on Monday. Would it be possible to set an interview any day after Tuesday Oct 30 next week?
